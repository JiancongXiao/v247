title: Top-$K$ ranking with a monotone adversary
section: Original Papers
abstract: In this paper, we address the top-$K$ ranking problem with a monotone adversary.
  We consider the scenario where a comparison graph is randomly generated and the
  adversary is allowed to add arbitrary edges.  The statistician’s goal is then to
  accurately identify the top-$K$ preferred items based on pairwise comparisons derived
  from this semi-random comparison graph.  The main contribution of this paper is  to
  develop a weighted maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) that achieves near-optimal
  sample complexity, up to a $\log^2(n)$ factor, where $n$ denotes the number of items
  under comparison. This is made possible through a combination of analytical and
  algorithmic innovations.  On the analytical front, we provide a refined $\ell_\infty$
  error analysis of the weighted MLE that is more explicit and tighter than existing
  analyses. It relates the $\ell_\infty$ error with the spectral properties of the
  weighted comparison graph. Motivated by this, our algorithmic innovation involves
  the development of an SDP-based approach to reweight the semi-random graph and meet
  specified spectral properties. Additionally, we propose a first-order method based
  on the Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) framework to solve the resulting
  SDP efficiently in nearly-linear time in the size of the semi-random comparison
  graph.
