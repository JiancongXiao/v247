title: Multiple-output composite quantile regression through an optimal transport
  lens
section: Original Papers
abstract: Composite quantile regression has been used to obtain robust estimators
  of regression coefficients in linear models with good statistical efficiency. By
  revealing an intrinsic link between the composite quantile regression loss function
  and the Wasserstein distance from the residuals to the set of quantiles, we establish
  a generalization of the composite quantile regression to the multiple-output settings.
  Theoretical convergence rates of the proposed estimator are derived both under the
  setting where the additive error possesses only a finite $\ell$-th moment (for $\ell
  > 2$) and where it exhibits a sub-Weibull tail. In doing so, we develop novel techniques
  for analyzing the M-estimation problem that involves Wasserstein-distance in the
  loss. Numerical studies confirm the practical effectiveness of our proposed procedure.
