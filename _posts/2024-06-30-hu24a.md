title: 'Open Problem: Optimal Rates for Stochastic Decision-Theoretic Online Learning
  Under Differentially Privacy'
section: Open Problems
abstract: For the stochastic variant of decision-theoretic online learning with $K$
  actions, $T$ rounds, and minimum gap $\Delta_{\min}$, the optimal, gap-dependent
  rate of the pseudo-regret is known to be $O \left( \frac{\log K}{\Delta_{\min}}
  \right)$. We ask to settle the optimal gap-dependent rate for the problem under
  $\varepsilon$-differential privacy.
