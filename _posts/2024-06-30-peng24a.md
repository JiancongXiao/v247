title: The complexity of approximate (coarse) correlated equilibrium for incomplete
  information games
section: Original Papers
abstract: "     We study the iteration complexity of decentralized learning of approximate
  correlated equilibria in incomplete information games.  On the negative side, we
  prove that in extensive-form games, assuming $\\mathsf{PPAD} \\not\\subset \\mathsf{TIME}(n^{\\polylog(n)})$,
  any polynomial-time learning algorithms must take at least $2^{\\log_2^{1-o(1)}(|\\mathcal{I}|)}$
  iterations to converge to the set of $\\epsilon$-approximate correlated equilibrium,
  where $|\\mathcal{I}|$ is the number of nodes in the game and $\\epsilon > 0$ is
  an absolute constant. This nearly matches, up to the $o(1)$ term, the algorithms
  of (Peng and Rubinstein STOC’2024, Dagan et al. STOC’2024) for learning $\\epsilon$-approximate
  correlated equilibrium, and resolves an open question of Anagnostides, Kalavasis,
  Sandholm, and Zampetakis (Anagnostides et al. ITCS 2024). Our lower bound holds
  even for the easier solution concept of $\\epsilon$-approximate coarse correlated
  equilibrium. On the positive side, we give uncoupled dynamics that reach $\\epsilon$-approximate
  correlated equilibria of a Bayesian game in polylogarithmic iterations, without
  any dependence of the number of types. This demonstrates a separation between Bayesian
  games and extensive-form games."
