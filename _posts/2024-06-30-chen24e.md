title: 'Open Problem: Black-Box Reductions and Adaptive Gradient Methods for Nonconvex
  Optimization'
section: Open Problems
abstract: 'We describe an open problem: reduce offline nonconvex stochastic optimization
  to regret minimization in online convex optimization. The conjectured reduction
  aims to make progress on explaining the success of adaptive gradient methods for
  deep learning. A prize of 500 dollars is offered to the winner.'
