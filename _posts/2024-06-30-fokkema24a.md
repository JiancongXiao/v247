title: Online Newton Method for Bandit Convex Optimisation Extended Abstract
section: Original Papers
abstract: We introduce a computationally efficient algorithm for zeroth-order bandit
  convex optimisation and prove that in the adversarial setting its regret is at most
  $d^{3.5} \sqrt{n} \mathrm{polylog}(n, d)$ with high probability where $d$ is the
  dimension and $n$ is the time horizon.  In the stochastic setting the bound improves
  to $M d^{2} \sqrt{n} \mathrm{polylog}(n, d)$ where $M \in [d^{-1/2}, d^{-1/4}]$
  is a constant that depends on the geometry of the constraint set and the desired
  computational properties.
