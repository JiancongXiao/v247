title: 'Sampling Polytopes with Riemannian HMC: Faster Mixing via the Lewis Weights
  Barrier'
section: Original Papers
abstract: We analyze Riemannian Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC) on a manifold endowed
  with the metric defined by the Hessian of a convex barrier function and apply it
  to sample a polytope defined by $m$ inequalities in $\R^n$. The advantage of RHMC
  over Euclidean methods such as the ball walk, hit-and-run and the Dikin walk is
  in its ability to take longer steps. However, in all previous work, the mixing rate
  of RHMC has a linear dependence on the number of inequalities. We introduce a hybrid
  of the Lewis weight barrier and the standard logarithmic barrier and prove that
  the mixing rate for the corresponding RHMC is bounded by $\tilde O(m^{1/3}n^{4/3})$,
  improving on the previous best bound of $\tilde O(mn^{2/3})$ (based on the log barrier).
  This continues the general parallels between optimization and sampling, with the
  latter typically leading to new tools and requiring more refined analysis. To prove
  our main results, we overcomes several challenges relating to the smoothness of
  Hamiltonian curves and self-concordance properties of the barrier. In the process,
  we give a general framework for the analysis of Markov chains on Riemannian manifolds,
  derive new smoothness bounds on Hamiltonian curves, a central topic of comparison
  geometry, and extend self-concordance theory to the infinity norm, which gives sharper
  bounds; these properties all appear to be of independent interest.
