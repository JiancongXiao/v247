title: 'Universal Lower Bounds and Optimal Rates: Achieving Minimax Clustering Error
  in Sub-Exponential Mixture Models'
section: Original Papers
abstract: Clustering is a pivotal challenge in unsupervised machine learning and is
  often investigated through the lens of mixture models. The optimal error rate for
  recovering cluster labels in Gaussian and sub-Gaussian mixture models involves ad
  hoc signal-to-noise ratios. Simple iterative algorithms, such as Lloyd’s algorithm,
  attain this optimal error rate. In this paper, we first establish a universal lower
  bound for the error rate in clustering any mixture model, expressed through Chernoff
  information, a more versatile measure of model information than signal-to-noise
  ratios. We then demonstrate that iterative algorithms attain this lower bound in
  mixture models with sub-exponential tails, notably emphasizing location-scale mixtures
  featuring Laplace-distributed errors. Additionally, for datasets better modelled
  by Poisson or Negative Binomial mixtures, we study mixture models whose distributions
  belong to an exponential family. In such mixtures, we establish that Bregman hard
  clustering, a variant of Lloyd’s algorithm employing a Bregman divergence, is rate
  optimal.
