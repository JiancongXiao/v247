title: 'Universal Rates for Regression: Separations between Cut-Off and Absolute Loss'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'In this work we initiate the study of regression in the universal rates
  framework of Bousquet et al. Unlike the traditional uniform learning setting, we
  are interested in obtaining learning guarantees that hold for all fixed data-generating
  distributions, but do not hold uniformly across them. We focus on the realizable
  setting and we consider two different well-studied loss functions: the cut-off loss
  at scale $\gamma > 0$, which asks for predictions that are $\gamma$-close to the
  correct one, and the absolute loss, which measures how far away the prediction is
  from the correct one.  Our results show that the landscape of the achievable rates
  in the two cases is completely different. First we give a trichotomic characterization
  of the optimal learning rates under the cut-off loss: each class is learnable either
  at an exponential rate, a (nearly) linear rate or requires arbitrarily slow rates.
  Moving to the absolute loss, we show that the achievable learning rates are significantly
  more involved by illustrating that an infinite number of different optimal learning
  rates is achievable. This is the first time that such a rich landscape of rates
  is obtained in the universal rates literature.'
