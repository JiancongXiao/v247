title: Online Structured Prediction with Fenchel–Young Losses and Improved Surrogate
  Regret for Online Multiclass Classification with Logistic Loss
section: Original Papers
abstract: This paper studies online structured prediction with full-information feedback.
  For online multiclass classification, Van der Hoeven (2020) established \emph{finite}
  surrogate regret bounds, which are independent of the time horizon, by introducing
  an elegant \emph{exploit-the-surrogate-gap} framework. However, this framework has
  been limited to multiclass classification primarily because it relies on a classification-specific
  procedure for converting estimated scores to outputs. We extend the exploit-the-surrogate-gap
  framework to online structured prediction with \emph{Fenchel–Young losses}, a large
  family of surrogate losses that includes the logistic loss for multiclass classification
  as a special case, obtaining finite surrogate regret bounds in various structured
  prediction problems. To this end, we propose and analyze \emph{randomized decoding},
  which converts estimated scores to general structured outputs. Moreover, by applying
  our decoding to online multiclass classification with the logistic loss, we obtain
  a surrogate regret bound of $O(\| \bm{U} \|_\mathrm{F}^2)$, where $\bm{U}$ is the
  best offline linear estimator and $\| \cdot \|_\mathrm{F}$ denotes the Frobenius
  norm. This bound is tight up to logarithmic factors and improves the previous bound
  of $O(d\| \bm{U} \|_\mathrm{F}^2)$ due to Van der Hoeven (2020) by a factor of $d$,
  the number of classes.
