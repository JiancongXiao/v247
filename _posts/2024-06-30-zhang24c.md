title: Spectral Estimators for Structured Generalized Linear Models via Approximate
  Message Passing (Extended Abstract)
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We consider the problem of parameter estimation in a high-dimensional generalized
  linear model. Spectral methods obtained via the principal eigenvector of a suitable
  data-dependent matrix provide a simple yet surprisingly effective solution. However,
  despite their wide use, a rigorous performance characterization, as well as a principled
  way to preprocess the data, are available only for unstructured (i.i.d. Gaussian
  and Haar orthogonal) designs. In contrast, real-world data matrices are highly structured
  and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address the problem, we consider correlated
  Gaussian designs capturing the anisotropic nature of the features via a covariance
  matrix $\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the
  performance of spectral estimators. This allows us to identify the optimal preprocessing
  that minimizes the number of samples needed for parameter estimation. Surprisingly,
  such preprocessing is universal across a broad set of statistical models, which
  partly addresses a conjecture on optimal spectral estimators for rotationally invariant
  designs. Our principled approach vastly improves upon previous heuristic methods,
  including for designs common in computational imaging and genetics. The proposed
  methodology, based on approximate message passing, is broadly applicable and opens
  the way to the precise characterization of spiked matrices and of the corresponding
  spectral methods in a variety of settings. '
