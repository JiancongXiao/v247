title: Computation-information gap in high-dimensional clustering
section: Original Papers
abstract: We investigate the existence of a fundamental computation-information gap
  for the problem of clustering a mixture of isotropic Gaussian in the high-dimensional
  regime, where the ambient dimension $p$ is larger than the number $n$ of points.
  The existence of a computation-information gap in a specific Bayesian high-dimensional
  asymptotic regime has been conjectured by Lesieur et. al (2016) based on the replica
  heuristic from statistical physics.  We provide  evidence of the existence of such
  a gap generically in the high-dimensional regime $p\geq n$, by (i)  proving a non-asymptotic
  low-degree polynomials computational barrier for clustering in high-dimension, matching
  the performance of the best known polynomial time algorithms, and by (ii) establishing
  that the information barrier for clustering is smaller than the computational barrier,
  when the number $K$ of clusters is large enough.  These results are in contrast
  with the (moderately) low-dimensional regime $n\geq \text{poly}(p,K)$, where there
  is no computation-information gap for clustering a mixture of isotropic Gaussian.  In
  order to prove our low-degree computational barrier, we develop sophisticated combinatorial
  arguments to upper-bound the mixed moments of the signal under a Bernoulli Bayesian
  model.
