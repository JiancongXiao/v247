title: Universally Instance-Optimal Mechanisms for Private Statistical Estimation
section: Original Papers
abstract: "     We consider the problem of instance-optimal statistical estimation
  under the constraint of differential privacy where mechanisms must adapt to the
  difficulty of the input dataset. We prove a new instance specific lower bound using
  a new divergence and show it characterizes the local minimax optimal rates for private
  statistical estimation. We propose two new mechanisms that are universally instance-optimal
  for general estimation problems up to logarithmic factors. Our first mechanism,
  the total variation mechanism, builds on the exponential mechanism with stable approximations
  of the total variation distance, and is universally instance-optimal in the high
  privacy regime $\\epsilon \\leq 1/\\sqrt{n}$. Our second mechanism, the T-mechanism,
  is based on the T-estimator framework (Birg{Ã©}, 2006) using the clipped log likelihood
  ratio as a stable test: it attains instance-optimal rates for any $\\epsilon \\leq
  1$ up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we study the implications of our results
  to robust statistical estimation, and show that our algorithms are universally optimal
  for this problem, characterizing the optimal minimax rates for robust statistical
  estimation. "
