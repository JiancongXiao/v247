title: The SMART approach to instance-optimal online learning
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We devise an online learning algorithm – titled Switching via Monotone
  Adapted Regret Traces (SMART) – that adapts to the data and achieves regret that
  is instance optimal, i.e., simultaneously competitive on every input sequence compared
  to the performance of the follow-the-leader (FTL) policy and the worst case guarantee
  of any other input policy.   We show that the regret of the SMART policy on any
  input sequence is within a multiplicative factor e/(e-1), approximately 1.58, of
  the smaller of: 1) the regret obtained by FTL on the sequence, and 2) the upper
  bound on regret guaranteed by the given worst-case policy. This implies a strictly
  stronger guarantee than typical ‘best-of-both-worlds’ bounds as the guarantee holds
  for every input sequence regardless of how it is generated. SMART is simple to implement
  as it begins by playing FTL and switches at most once during the time horizon to
  the worst-case algorithm. Our approach and results follow from a reduction of instance
  optimal online learning to competitive analysis for the ski-rental problem.  We
  complement our competitive ratio upper bounds with a fundamental lower bound showing
  that over all input sequences, no algorithm can get better than a 1.43-fraction
  of the minimum regret achieved by FTL and the minimax-optimal policy. We present
  a modification of SMART that combines FTL with a “small-loss" algorithm to achieve
  instance optimality between the regret of FTL and the small loss regret bound. '
