title: Safe Linear Bandits over Unknown Polytopes
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'The safe linear bandit problem (SLB) is an online approach to linear programming
  with unknown objective and unknown \emph{roundwise} constraints, under stochastic
  bandit feedback of rewards and safety risks of actions. We study the tradeoffs between
  efficacy and smooth safety costs of SLBs over polytopes, and the role of aggressive
  {doubly-optimistic play} in avoiding the strong assumptions made by extant pessimistic-optimistic
  approaches.  We first elucidate an inherent hardness in SLBs due the lack of knowledge
  of constraints: there exist ‘easy’ instances, for which suboptimal extreme points
  have large ‘gaps’, but on which SLB methods must still incur $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$
  regret or safety violations, due to an inability to resolve unknown optima to arbitrary
  precision. We then analyse a natural doubly-optimistic strategy for the safe linear
  bandit problem, \textsc{doss}, which uses optimistic estimates of both reward and
  safety risks to select actions, and show that despite the lack of knowledge of constraints
  or feasible points, \textsc{doss} simultaneously obtains tight instance-dependent
  $O(\log^2 T)$ bounds on efficacy regret, and $\widetilde O(\sqrt{T})$ bounds on
  safety violations, thus attaining near Pareto-optimality. Further, when safety is
  demanded to a finite precision, violations improve to $O(\log^2 T).$ These results
  rely on a novel dual analysis of linear bandits: we argue that \textsc{doss} proceeds
  by activating noisy versions of at least $d$ constraints in each round, which allows
  us to separately analyse rounds where a ‘poor’ set of constraints is activated,
  and rounds where ‘good’ sets of constraints are activated. The costs in the former
  are controlled to $O(\log^2 T)$ by developing new dual notions of gaps, based on
  global sensitivity analyses of linear programs, that quantify the suboptimality
  of each such set of constraints. The latter costs are controlled to $O(1)$ by explicitly
  analysing the solutions of optimistic play. '
