title: Depth Separation in Norm-Bounded Infinite-Width Neural Networks
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We study depth separation in infinite-width neural networks, where complexity
  is controlled by the overall squared $\ell_2$-norm of the weights (sum of squares
  of all weights in the network). Whereas previous depth separation results focused
  on separation in terms of width, such results do not give insight into whether depth
  determines if it is possible to learn a network that generalizes well even when
  the network width is unbounded.  Here, we study separation in terms of the sample
  complexity required for learnability. Specifically, we show that there are functions
  that are learnable with sample complexity polynomial in the input dimension by norm-controlled
  depth-3 ReLU networks, yet are not learnable with sub-exponential sample complexity
  by norm-controlled depth-2 ReLU networks (with any value for the norm). We also
  show that a similar statement in the reverse direction is not possible:  any function
  learnable with polynomial sample complexity by a norm-controlled depth-2 ReLU network
  with infinite width is also learnable with polynomial sample complexity by a norm-controlled
  depth-3 ReLU network.'
