title: 'Statistical curriculum learning: An elimination algorithm achieving an oracle
  risk'
section: Original Papers
abstract: We consider a statistical version of curriculum learning (CL) in a parametric
  prediction setting. The learner is required to estimate a target parameter vector,
  and can adaptively collect samples from either the target model, or other source
  models that are similar to the target model, but less noisy. We consider three types
  of learners, depending on the level of side-information they receive. The first
  two, referred to as strong/weak-oracle learners, receive high/low degrees of information
  about the models, and use these to learn. The third, a fully adaptive learner, estimates
  the target parameter vector without any prior information. In the single source
  case, we propose an elimination learning method, whose risk matches that of a strong-oracle
  learner. In the multiple source case, we advocate that the risk of the weak-oracle
  learner is a realistic benchmark for the risk of adaptive learners. We develop an
  adaptive multiple elimination-rounds CL algorithm, and characterize instance-dependent
  conditions for its risk to match that of the weak-oracle learner. We consider instance-dependent
  minimax lower bounds, and discuss the challenges associated with defining the class
  of instances for the bound. We derive two minimax lower bounds, and determine the
  conditions under which the performance weak-oracle learner is minimax optimal.
