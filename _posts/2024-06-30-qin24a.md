title: 'Fit Like You Sample: Sample-Efficient Generalized Score Matching from Fast
  Mixing Diffusions'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Score matching is an approach to learning probability distributions parametrized
  up to a constant of proportionality (e.g., energy-based models). The idea is to
  fit the score of the distribution rather than the likelihood, thus avoiding the
  need to evaluate the constant of proportionality. While there’s a clear algorithmic
  benefit, the statistical cost can be steep: recent work by Koehler et al. (2022)
  showed that for distributions that have poor isoperimetric properties (a large Poincar{é}
  or log-Sobolev constant), score matching is substantially statistically less efficient
  than maximum likelihood. However, many natural realistic distributions, e.g. multimodal
  distributions as simple as a mixture of two Gaussians in one dimension have a poor
  Poincar{é} constant. In this paper, we show a close connection between the mixing
  time of a broad class of Markov processes with generator L and stationary distribution
  p, and an appropriately chosen generalized score matching loss that tries to fit
  Op. In the special case of O being a gradient operator, and L being the generator
  of Langevin diffusion, this generalizes and recovers the results from Koehler et
  al. (2022). This allows us to adapt techniques to speed up Markov chains to construct
  better score-matching losses. In particular, "preconditioning" the diffusion can
  be translated to an appropriate "preconditioning" of the score loss. Lifting the
  chain by adding a temperature like in simulated tempering can be shown to result
  in a Gaussian-convolution annealed score matching loss, similar to Song and Ermon
  (2019). Moreover, we show that if the distribution being learned is a finite mixture
  of Gaussians in d dimensions with a shared covariance, the sample complexity of
  annealed score matching is polynomial in the ambient dimension, the diameter of
  the means, and the smallest and largest eigenvalues of the covariance. To show this
  we bound the mixing time of a "continuously tempered" version of Langevin diffusion
  for mixtures, which is of standalone interest.'
