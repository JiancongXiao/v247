title: 'The Star Number and Eluder Dimension: Elementary Observations About the Dimensions
  of Disagreement'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'This article presents a number of elementary observations and relations
  concerning commonly-studied combinatorial dimensions from the learning theory literature
  on classification and reinforcement learning: namely, the star number, eluder dimension,
  VC dimension, Littlestone dimension, threshold dimension, and cardinality of the
  class. One theme of the work is understanding how these dimensions may be re-expressed
  as natural dimensions of the convexity space of version spaces. Specifically, we
  find that the star number is precisely the VC dimension of version spaces (and of
  their disagreement regions), whereas the eluder dimension is precisely the threshold
  dimension of version spaces (and of their disagreement regions). We are also interested
  in understanding direct relations among these dimensions. For instance, we show
  that there is no infinite concept class with both finite Littlestone dimension and
  finite star number. Moreover, any infinite concept class must have infinite eluder
  dimension. In both cases, we also provide quantitative relations to the cardinality
  of the class. For the latter result, we also show an analogous relation for real-valued
  functions, where the cardinality of the class is replaced by the $L_\infty$ covering
  number. As another relation between star numbers and VC dimension, we provide a
  simple, precise, and general characterization of the VC dimension of the minimal
  intersection-closed class containing a given concept class: namely, the 1-centered
  star number of the original class. Moreover, we generalize this result to provide
  a unifying approach to the design of certain sample compression schemes, along with
  a simple combinatorial dimension characterizing its compression size: the minimum
  star number. We also discuss a number of implications of many of these observations.
  Though the proofs of the above observations are actually all incredibly simple,
  it is interesting that such fundamental relations among these well-known quantities
  appear to have heretofore gone unnoticed in the literature.'
