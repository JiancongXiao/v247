title: Learnability Gaps of Strategic Classification
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'In contrast with standard classification tasks, strategic classification
  involves agents strategically modifying their features in an effort to receive favorable
  predictions. For instance, given a classifier determining loan approval based on
  credit scores, applicants may open or close their credit cards and bank accounts
  to fool the classifier. The learning goal is to find a classifier robust against
  strategic manipulations. Various settings, based on what and when information is
  known, have been explored in strategic classification. In this work, we focus on
  addressing a fundamental question: the learnability gaps between strategic classification
  and standard learning.  We essentially show that any learnable class is also strategically
  learnable: we first consider a fully informative setting, where the manipulation
  structure (which is modeled by a manipulation graph $G^\star$) is known and during
  training time the learner has access to both the pre-manipulation data and post-manipulation
  data. We provide nearly tight sample complexity and regret bounds, offering significant
  improvements over prior results. Then, we relax the fully informative setting by
  introducing two natural types of uncertainty.  First, following Ahmadi et al. (2023),
  we consider the setting in which the learner only has access to the post-manipulation
  data. We improve the results of Ahmadi et al. (2023) and close the gap between mistake
  upper bound and lower bound raised by them.  Our second relaxation of the fully
  informative setting introduces uncertainty to the manipulation structure. That is,
  we assume that the manipulation graph is unknown but belongs to a known class of
  graphs. We provide nearly tight bounds on the learning complexity in various unknown
  manipulation graph settings. Notably, our algorithm in this setting is of independent
  interest and can be applied to other problems such as multi-label learning.'
