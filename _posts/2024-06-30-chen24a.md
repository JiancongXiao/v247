title: 'On Finding Small Hyper-Gradients in Bilevel Optimization: Hardness Results
  and Improved Analysis'
section: Original Papers
abstract: Bilevel optimization reveals the inner structure of otherwise oblique optimization
  problems, such as hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture search, and meta-learning.  A
  common goal in bilevel optimization is to minimize a hyper-objective that implicitly
  depends on the solution set of the lower-level function. Although this hyper-objective
  approach is widely used, its theoretical properties have not been thoroughly investigated
  in cases where \textit{the lower-level functions lack strong convexity}.  In this
  work, we first provide hardness results to show that the goal of finding stationary
  points of the hyper-objective for nonconvex-convex bilevel optimization can be intractable
  for zero-respecting algorithms. Then we study a class of tractable nonconvex-nonconvex
  bilevel problems when the lower-level function satisfies the Polyak-≈Å{}ojasiewicz
  (PL) condition. We show a simple first-order algorithm can achieve complexity bounds
  of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$, $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$ and
  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$ in the deterministic, partially stochastic,
  and fully stochastic setting respectively.
