title: 'Projection by Convolution: Optimal Sample Complexity for Reinforcement Learning
  in Continuous-Space MDPs'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We consider the problem of learning an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in
  a general class of continuous-space Markov decision processes (MDPs) having smooth
  Bellman operators. Given access to a generative model, we achieve rate-optimal sample
  complexity by performing a simple, \emph{perturbed} version of least-squares value
  iteration with orthogonal trigonometric polynomials as features. Key to our solution
  is a novel projection technique based on ideas from harmonic analysis.  OurÂ $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2-d/(\nu+1)})$
  sample complexity, where $d$ is the dimension of the state-action space and $\nu$
  the order of smoothness, recovers the state-of-the-art result of discretization
  approaches for the special case of Lipschitz MDPs $(\nu=0)$. At the same time, for
  $\nu\to\infty$, it recovers and greatly generalizes the $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ rate
  of low-rank MDPs, which are more amenable to regression approaches. In this sense,
  our result bridges the gap between two popular but conflicting perspectives on continuous-space
  MDPs.  '
