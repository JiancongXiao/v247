title: The Limits and Potentials of Local SGD for Distributed Heterogeneous Learning
  with Intermittent Communication
section: Original Papers
abstract: Local SGD is a popular optimization method in distributed learning, often
  outperforming mini-batch SGD. Despite this practical success, proving the efficiency
  of local SGD has been difficult, creating a significant gap between theory and practice.
  We provide new lower bounds for local SGD under existing first-order data heterogeneity
  assumptions, showing these assumptions can not capture local SGDâ€™s effectiveness.
  We also demonstrate the min-max optimality of accelerated mini-batch SGD under these
  assumptions. Our findings emphasize the need for improved modeling of data heterogeneity.  Under
  higher-order assumptions, we provide new upper bounds that verify the dominance
  of local SGD over mini-batch SGD when data heterogeneity is low.
