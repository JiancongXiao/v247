title: Physics-informed machine learning as a kernel method
section: Original Papers
abstract: Physics-informed machine learning combines the expressiveness of data-based
  approaches with the interpretability of physical models. In this context, we consider
  a general regression problem where the empirical risk is regularized by a partial
  differential equation that quantifies the physical inconsistency. We prove that
  for linear differential priors, the problem can be formulated as a kernel regression
  task. Taking advantage of kernel theory, we derive convergence rates for the minimizer
  $\hat f_n$ of the regularized risk and show that $\hat f_n$ converges at least at
  the Sobolev minimax rate. However, faster rates can be achieved, depending on the
  physical error. This principle is illustrated with a one-dimensional example, supporting
  the claim that regularizing the empirical risk with physical information can be
  beneficial to the statistical performance of estimators.
