title: Dimension-free Structured Covariance Estimation
section: Original Papers
abstract: Given a sample of i.i.d. high-dimensional centered random vectors, we consider
  a problem of estimation of their covariance matrix $\Sigma$ with an additional assumption
  that $\Sigma$ can be represented as a sum of a few Kronecker products of smaller
  matrices. Under mild conditions, we derive the first non-asymptotic dimension-free
  high-probability bound on the Frobenius distance between $\Sigma$ and a widely used
  penalized permuted least squares estimate. Because of the hidden structure, the
  established rate of convergence is faster than in the standard covariance estimation
  problem.
