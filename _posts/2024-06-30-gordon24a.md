title: Identification of mixtures of discrete product distributions in near-optimal
  sample and time complexity
section: Original Papers
abstract: We consider the problem of \emph{identifying,} from statistics, a distribution
  of discrete random variables $X_1 \ldots,X_n$ that is a mixture of $k$ product distributions.
  The best previous sample complexity for $n \in O(k)$ was $(1/\zeta)^{O(k^2 \log
  k)}$ (under a mild separation assumption parameterized by $\zeta$). The best known
  lower bound was $\exp(\Omega(k))$. It is known that $n\geq 2k-1$ is necessary and
  sufficient for identification. We show, for any $n\geq 2k-1$, how to achieve sample
  complexity and run-time complexity $(1/\zeta)^{O(k)}$.  We also extend the known
  lower bound of $e^{\Omega(k)}$ to match our upper bound across a broad range of
  $\zeta$. Our results are obtained by combining (a) a classic method for robust tensor
  decomposition, (b) a novel way of bounding the condition number of key matrices
  called Hadamard extensions, by studying their action only on flattened rank-1 tensors.
