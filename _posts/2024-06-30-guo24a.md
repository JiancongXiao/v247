title: Stochastic Constrained Contextual Bandits via Lyapunov Optimization Based Estimation
  to Decision Framework
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'This paper studies the problem of stochastic constrained contextual bandits
  (CCB) under general realizability condition where the expected rewards and costs
  are within general function classes. We propose LOE2D, a Lyapunov Optimization Based
  Estimation to Decision framework with online regression oracles for learning reward/constraint.
  LOE2D establishes $\Tilde O(T^{\frac{3}{4}}U^{\frac{1}{4}})$ regret and constraint
  violation, which can be further refined to $\Tilde O(\min\{\sqrt{TU}/\varepsilon^2,
  T^{\frac{3}{4}}U^{\frac{1}{4}}\})$ when the Slater condition holds in the underlying
  offline problem with the Slater “constant” $ \varepsilon=\Omega(\sqrt{U/T}),$ where
  $U$ denotes the error bounds of online regression oracles. These results improve
  LagrangeCBwLC in two aspects: i) our results hold without any prior information
  while LagrangeCBwLC requires the knowledge of Slater constant to design a proper
  learning rate; ii) our results hold when $\varepsilon=\Omega(\sqrt{U/T})$ while
  LagrangeCBwLC requires a constant margin $\varepsilon=\Omega(1).$ These improvements
  stem from two novel techniques: violation-adaptive learning in E2D module and multi-step
  Lyapunov drift analysis in bounding constraint violation. The experiments further
  justify LOE2D outperforms the baseline algorithm. '
