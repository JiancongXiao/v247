title: Computational-Statistical Gaps in Gaussian Single-Index Models (Extended Abstract)
section: Original Papers
abstract: Single-Index Models are high-dimensional regression problems with planted
  structure, whereby labels depend on an unknown one-dimensional projection of the
  input via a generic, non-linear, and potentially non-deterministic transformation.
  As such, they encompass a broad class of statistical inference tasks, and provide
  a rich template to study statistical and computational trade-offs in the high-dimensional
  regime.  While the information-theoretic sample complexity to recover the hidden
  direction is linear in the dimension $d$, we show that computationally efficient
  algorithms, both within the Statistical Query (SQ) and the Low-Degree Polynomial
  (LDP) framework, necessarily require $\Omega(d^{k^\star/2})$ samples, where $k^\star$
  is a “generative” exponent associated with the model that we explicitly characterize.
  Moreover, we show that this sample complexity is also sufficient, by establishing
  matching upper bounds using a partial-trace algorithm. Therefore, our results provide
  evidence of a sharp computational-to-statistical gap (under both the SQ and LDP
  class) whenever $k^\star>2$. To complete the study, we construct smooth and Lipschitz
  deterministic target functions with arbitrarily large generative exponents $k^\star$.
