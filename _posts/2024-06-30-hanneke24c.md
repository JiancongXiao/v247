title: 'Open problem: Direct Sums in Learning Theory'
section: Open Problems
abstract: In computer science, the term ’direct sum’ refers to fundamental questions
  about the scaling of computational or information complexity with respect to multiple
  task instances. Consider an algorithmic task \({T} \){and} a computational resource
  \({C} \). For instance, \({T} \){might} be the task of computing a polynomial, with
  \({C} \){representing} the number of arithmetic operations required, or \({T} \){could}
  be a learning task with its sample complexity as \({C} \). The direct sum inquiry
  focuses on the cost of solving \({k} \){separate} instances of \({T} \), particularly
  how this aggregate cost compares to the resources needed for a single instance.
  Typically, the cost for multiple instances is at most \({k} \){times} the cost of
  one, since each can be handled independently. However, there are intriguing scenarios
  where the total cost for \({k} \){instances} is less than this linear relationship.
  Such questions naturally extend to the machine-learning setting in which one may
  be interested in solving several learning problems at once. This notion of direct
  sums of learning problems gives rise to various natural questions and interesting
  problems
