title: Lower Bounds for Differential Privacy Under Continual Observation and Online
  Threshold Queries
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'One of the most basic problems for studying the “price of privacy over
  time” is the so called {\em private counter problem}, introduced by Dwork et al.
  (2010) and Chan et al. (2011).  In this problem, we aim to track the number of {\em
  events} that occur over time, while hiding the existence of every single event.
  More specifically, in every time step $t\in[T]$ we learn (in an online fashion)
  that $\Delta_t\geq 0$ new events have occurred, and must respond with an estimate
  $n_t\approx\sum_{j=1}^t \Delta_j$. The privacy requirement is that {\em all of the
  outputs together}, across all time steps, satisfy {\em event level} differential
  privacy.  The main question here is how our error needs to depend on the total number
  of time steps $T$ and the total number of events $n$. Dwork et al. (2015) showed
  an upper bound of $O\left(\log(T)+\log^2(n)\right)$, and Henzinger et al. (2023)
  showed a lower bound of $\Omega\left( \min\{\log n, \log T\} \right)$. We show a
  new lower bound of $\Omega\left(\min\{n,\log T\}\right)$, which is tight w.r.t.
  the dependence on $T$, and is tight in the sparse case where $\log^2 n=O(\log T)$.
  Our lower bound has the following implications: \begin{itemize} \item We show that
  our lower bound extends to the {\em online thresholds} problem, where the goal is
  to privately answer many “quantile queries” when these queries are presented one-by-one.
  This resolves an open question of Bun et al. (2017). \item Our lower bound implies,
  for the first time, a separation between the number of mistakes obtainable by a
  private online learner and a non-private online learner. This partially resolves
  a COLT’22 open question published by Sanyal and Ramponi. \item Our lower bound also
  yields the first separation between the standard model of private online learning
  and a recently proposed relaxed variant of it, called {\em private online prediction}.
  \end{itemize} '
