title: Convergence of Kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo on Lie groups
section: Original Papers
abstract: " Explicit, momentum-based dynamics for optimizing functions defined on
  Lie groups was recently constructed, based on techniques such as variational optimization
  and left trivialization. We appropriately add tractable noise to the optimization
  dynamics to turn it into a sampling dynamics, leveraging the advantageous feature
  that the trivialized momentum variable is Euclidean despite that the potential function
  lives on a manifold. We then propose a Lie-group MCMC sampler, by delicately discretizing
  the resulting kinetic-Langevin-type sampling dynamics. The Lie group structure is
  exactly preserved by this discretization. Exponential convergence with explicit
  convergence rate for both the continuous dynamics and the discrete sampler are then
  proved under $W_2$ distance. Only compactness of the Lie group and geodesically
  $L$-smoothness of the potential function are needed. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first convergence result for kinetic Langevin on curved spaces, and
  also the first quantitative result that requires no convexity or, at least not explicitly,
  any common relaxation such as isoperimetry."
