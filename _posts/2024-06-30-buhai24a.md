title: Computational-Statistical Gaps for Improper Learning in Sparse Linear Regression
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study computational-statistical gaps for improper learning in sparse
  linear regression. More specifically, given $n$ samples from a $k$-sparse linear
  model in dimension $d$, we ask what is the minimum sample complexity to efficiently
  (in time polynomial in $d$, $k$, and $n$) find a potentially dense estimate for
  the regression vector that achieves non-trivial prediction error on the $n$ samples.
  Information-theoretically this can be achieved using $\Theta(k \log (d/k))$ samples.
  Yet, despite its prominence in the literature, there is no polynomial-time algorithm
  known to achieve the same guarantees using less than $\Theta(d)$ samples without
  additional restrictions on the model. Similarly, existing hardness results are either
  restricted to the proper setting, in which the estimate must be sparse as well,
  or only apply to specific algorithms. We give evidence that efficient algorithms
  for this task require at least (roughly) $\Omega(k^2)$ samples. In particular, we
  show that an improper learning algorithm for sparse linear regression can be used
  to solve sparse PCA problems (with a negative spike) in their Wishart form, in regimes
  in which efficient algorithms are widely believed to require at least $\Omega(k^2)$
  samples. We complement our reduction with low-degree and statistical query lower
  bounds for the sparse PCA problems from which we reduce. Our hardness results apply
  to the (correlated) random design setting in which the covariates are drawn i.i.d.
  from a mean-zero Gaussian distribution with unknown covariance.
