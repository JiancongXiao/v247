title: Online Policy Optimization in Unknown Nonlinear Systems
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study online policy optimization in nonlinear time-varying systems where
  the true dynamical models are unknown to the controller. This problem is challenging
  because, unlike in linear systems, the controller cannot obtain globally accurate
  estimations of the ground-truth dynamics using local exploration. We propose a meta-framework
  that combines a general online policy optimization algorithm (\texttt{ALG}) with
  a general online estimator of the dynamical system’s model parameters (\texttt{EST}).
  We show that if the hypothetical joint dynamics induced by \texttt{ALG} with \emph{known}
  parameters satisfies several desired properties, the joint dynamics under \emph{inexact}
  parameters from \texttt{EST} will be robust to errors. Importantly, the final regret
  only depends on \texttt{EST}’s predictions on the visited trajectory, which relaxes
  a bottleneck on identifying the true parameters globally. To demonstrate our framework,
  we develop a computationally efficient variant of Gradient-based Adaptive Policy
  Selection, called Memoryless GAPS (M-GAPS), and use it to instantiate \texttt{ALG}.
  Combining \mbox{M-GAPS} with online gradient descent to instantiate \texttt{EST}
  yields (to our knowledge) the first local regret bound for online policy optimization
  in nonlinear time-varying systems with unknown dynamics.
