title: 'Open Problem: Can Local Regularization Learn All Multiclass Problems?'
section: Open Problems
abstract: 'Multiclass classification is the simple generalization of binary classification
  to arbitrary label sets. Despite its simplicity, it has been remarkably resistant
  to study: a characterization of multiclass learnability was established only two
  years ago by Brukhim et al. 2022, and the understanding of optimal learners for
  multiclass problems remains fairly limited. We ask whether there exists a simple
  algorithmic template — akin to empirical risk minimization (ERM) for binary classification
  — which characterizes multiclass learning. Namely, we ask whether local regularization,
  introduced by Asilis et al. 2024, is sufficiently expressive to learn all multiclass
  problems possible. Towards (negatively) resolving the problem, we propose a hypothesis
  class which may not be learnable by any such local regularizer.'
