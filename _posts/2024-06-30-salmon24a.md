title: Provable Advantage in Quantum PAC Learning
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We revisit the problem of characterising the complexity of Quantum PAC
  learning, as introduced by Bshouty and Jackson [SIAM J. Comput. 1998, 28, 1136â€“1153].
  Several quantum advantages have been demonstrated in this setting, however, none
  are generic: they apply to particular concept classes and typically only work when
  the distribution that generates the data is known. In the general case, it was recently
  shown by Arunachalam and de Wolf [JMLR, 19 (2018) 1-36] that quantum PAC learners
  can only achieve constant factor advantages over classical PAC learners. We show
  that with a natural extension of the definition of quantum PAC learning used by
  Arunachalam and de Wolf, we can achieve a generic advantage in quantum learning.
  To be precise, for any concept class $\mathcal{C}$ of VC dimension $d$, we show
  there is an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-quantum PAC learner with sample complexity \[{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\left[d+
  \log(\frac{1}{\delta})\right]\log^9(1/\epsilon)\right). \]{Up} to polylogarithmic
  factors, this is a square root improvement over the classical learning sample complexity.
  We show the tightness of our result by proving an $\Omega(d/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ lower
  bound that matches our upper bound up to polylogarithmic factors.'
