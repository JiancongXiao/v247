title: The Real Price of Bandit Information in Multiclass Classification
section: Original Papers
abstract: We revisit the classical problem of multiclass classification with bandit
  feedback (Kakade, Shalev-Shwartz and Tewari, 2008), where each input classifies
  to one of $K$ possible labels and feedback is restricted to whether the predicted
  label is correct or not. Our primary inquiry is with regard to the dependency on
  the number of labels $K$, and whether $T$-step regret bounds in this setting can
  be improved beyond the $\smash{\sqrt{KT}}$ dependence exhibited by existing algorithms.  Our
  main contribution is in showing that the minimax regret of bandit multiclass is
  in fact more nuanced, and is of the form $\smash{\widetilde{\Theta}(\min |\mathcal{H}|
  + \sqrt{T}, \sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{H}|})}$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is the underlying
  (finite) hypothesis class. In particular, we present a new bandit classification
  algorithm that guarantees regret $\smash{\widetilde{O}(|\mathcal{H}|+\sqrt{T})}$,
  improving over classical algorithms for moderately-sized hypothesis classes, and
  give a matching lower bound establishing tightness of the upper bounds (up to log-factors)
  in all parameter regimes.
