title: Second Order Methods for Bandit Optimization and Control
section: Original Papers
abstract: Bandit convex optimization (BCO) is a general framework for online decision
  making under uncertainty.  While tight regret bounds for general convex losses have
  been established,  existing algorithms achieving these bounds have prohibitive computational
  costs for high dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a simple and practical
  BCO algorithm inspired by the online Newton step algorithm. We show that our algorithm
  achieves optimal (in terms of horizon) regret bounds for a large class of convex
  functions that satisfy a condition we call $\kappa$-convexity. This class contains
  a wide range of practically relevant loss functions including linear losses, quadratic
  losses, and generalized linear models. In addition to optimal regret,  this method
  is the most efficient known algorithm for several well-studied applications including
  bandit logistic regression. Furthermore, we investigate the adaptation of our second-order
  bandit algorithm to online convex optimization with memory. We show that for loss
  functions with a certain affine structure, the extended algorithm attains optimal
  regret. This leads to an algorithm with optimal regret for bandit LQ problem under
  a fully adversarial noise model, thereby resolving an open question posed in Grade
  et. al. 2020 and Sun et. al. 2023. Finally, we show that the more general problem
  of BCO with (non-affine) memory is harder. We derive a  $\tilde{\Omega}(T^{2/3})$
  regret lower bound, even under the assumption of smooth and quadratic losses.
