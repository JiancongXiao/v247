title: Testable Learning of General Halfspaces with Adversarial Label Noise
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We study the task of testable learning of general — not necessarily homogeneous
  — halfspaces with adversarial label noise with respect to the Gaussian distribution.
  In the testable learning framework, the goal is to develop a tester-learner such
  that if the data passes the tester, then one can trust the output of the robust
  learner on the data. Our main result is the first polynomial time tester-learner
  for general halfspaces that achieves dimension-independent misclassification error.
  At the heart of our approach is a new methodology to reduce testable learning of
  general halfspaces to testable learning of \snew{nearly} homogeneous halfspaces
  that may be of broader interest. '
