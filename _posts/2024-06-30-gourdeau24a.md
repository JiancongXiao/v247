title: On the Computability of Robust PAC Learning
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We initiate the study of computability requirements for adversarially robust
  learning. Adversarially robust PAC-type learnability is by now an established field
  of research. However, the effects of computability requirements in PAC-type frameworks
  are only just starting to emerge.  We introduce the problem of robust computable
  PAC (robust CPAC) learning and provide some simple sufficient conditions for this.  We
  then show that learnability in this setup is not implied by the combination of its
  components: classes that are both CPAC and robustly PAC learnable are not necessarily
  robustly CPAC learnable.  Furthermore, we show that the novel framework exhibits
  some surprising effects: for robust CPAC learnability it is not required that the
  robust loss is computably evaluable! Towards understanding characterizing properties,
  we introduce a novel dimension, the computable robust shattering dimension.  We
  prove that its finiteness is necessary, but not sufficient for robust CPAC learnability.  This
  might yield novel insights for the corresponding phenomenon in the context of robust
  PAC learnability, where insufficiency of the robust shattering dimension for learnability
  has been conjectured, but so far a resolution has remained elusive.'
