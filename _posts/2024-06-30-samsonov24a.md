title: Improved High-Probability Bounds for the Temporal Difference Learning Algorithm
  via Exponential Stability
section: Original Papers
abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of obtaining sharp bounds for the
  performance of temporal difference (TD) methods with linear function approximation
  for policy evaluation in discounted Markov decision processes. We show that a simple
  algorithm with a universal and instance-independent step size together with Polyak-Ruppert
  tail averaging is sufficient to obtain near-optimal variance and bias terms. We
  also provide the respective sample complexity bounds. Our proof technique is based
  on refined error bounds for linear stochastic approximation together with the novel
  stability result for the product of random matrices that arise from the TD-type
  recurrence.
