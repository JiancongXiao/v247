title: A Unified Characterization of Private Learnability via Graph Theory
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We provide a unified framework for characterizing pure and approximate
  differentially private (DP) learnability. The framework uses the language of graph
  theory: for a concept class $\mathcal{H}$, we define the contradiction graph $G$
  of $\mathcal{H}$. Its vertices are realizable datasets and two datasets $S,S’$ are
  connected by an edge if they contradict each other (i.e., there is a point $x$ that
  is labeled differently in $S$ and $S’$). Our main finding is that the combinatorial
  structure of $G$ is deeply related to learning $\mathcal{H}$ under DP. Learning
  $\mathcal{H}$ under pure DP is captured by the fractional clique number of $G$.
  Learning $\mathcal{H}$ under approximate DP is captured by the clique number of
  $G$. Consequently, we identify graph-theoretic dimensions that characterize DP learnability:
  the \emph{clique dimension} and \emph{fractional clique dimension}. Along the way,
  we reveal properties of the contradiction graph which may be of independent interest.
  We also suggest several open questions and directions for future research.'
