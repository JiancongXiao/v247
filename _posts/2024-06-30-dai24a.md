title: Refined Sample Complexity for Markov Games with Independent Linear Function
  Approximation (Extended Abstract)
section: Original Papers
abstract: Markov Games (MG) is an important model for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
  (MARL). It was long believed that the “curse of multi-agents” (i.e., the algorithmic
  performance drops exponentially with the number of agents) is unavoidable until
  several recent works (Daskalakis et al., 2023; Cui et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023).
  While these works resolved the curse of multi-agents, when the state spaces are
  prohibitively large and (linear) function approximations are deployed, they either
  had a slower convergence rate of $O(T^{-1/4})$ or brought a polynomial dependency
  on the number of actions $A_{\max}$ – which is avoidable in single-agent cases even
  when the loss functions can arbitrarily vary with time. This paper first refines
  the AVLPR framework by Wang et al. (2023), with an insight of designing \textit{data-dependent}
  (i.e., stochastic) pessimistic estimation of the sub-optimality gap, allowing a
  broader choice of plug-in algorithms. When specialized to MGs with independent linear
  function approximations, we propose novel \textit{action-dependent bonuses} to cover
  occasionally extreme estimation errors. With the help of state-of-the-art techniques
  from the single-agent RL literature, we give the first algorithm that tackles the
  curse of multi-agents, attains the optimal $O(T^{-1/2})$ convergence rate, and avoids
  $\text{poly}(A_{\max})$ dependency simultaneously.
