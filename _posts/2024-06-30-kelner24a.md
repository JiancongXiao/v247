title: 'Lasso with Latents: Efficient Estimation, Covariate Rescaling, and Computational-Statistical
  Gaps'
section: Original Papers
abstract: It is well-known that the statistical performance of Lasso can suffer significantly
  when the covariates of interest have strong correlations. In particular, the prediction
  error of Lasso becomes much worse than computationally inefficient alternatives
  like Best Subset Selection. Due to a large conjectured computational-statistical
  tradeoff in the problem of sparse linear regression, it may be impossible to close
  this gap in general. In this work, we propose a natural sparse linear regression
  setting where strong correlations between covariates arise from unobserved latent
  variables. In this setting, we analyze the problem caused by strong correlations
  and design a surprisingly simple fix. While Lasso with standard normalization of
  covariates fails, there exists a heterogeneous scaling of the covariates with which
  Lasso will suddenly obtain strong provable guarantees for estimation. Moreover,
  we design a simple, efficient procedure for computing such a “smart scaling.” The
  sample complexity of the resulting “rescaled Lasso” algorithm incurs (in the worst
  case) quadratic dependence on the sparsity of the underlying signal. While this
  dependence is not information-theoretically necessary, we give evidence that it
  is optimal among the class of polynomial-time algorithms, via the method of low-degree
  polynomials. This argument reveals a new connection between sparse linear regression
  and a special version of sparse PCA with a \emph{near-critical negative spike}.
  The latter problem can be thought of as a real-valued analogue of learning a sparse
  parity. Using it, we also establish the first computational-statistical gap for
  the closely related problem of learning a Gaussian Graphical Model.
