title: Online Learning with Set-valued Feedback
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We study a variant of online multiclass classification where the learner
  predicts a single label but receives a \textit{set of labels} as feedback. In this
  model, the learner is penalized for not outputting a label contained in the revealed
  set. We show that unlike online multiclass learning with single-label feedback,
  deterministic and randomized online learnability are \textit{not equivalent} even
  in the realizable setting with set-valued feedback. Accordingly, we give two new
  combinatorial dimensions, named the Set Littlestone and Measure Shattering dimension,
  that tightly characterize deterministic and randomized online learnability respectively
  in the realizable setting. In addition, we show that the Measure Shattering dimension
  characterizes online learnability in the agnostic setting and tightly quantifies
  the minimax regret. Finally, we use our results to establish bounds on the minimax
  regret for three practical learning settings:  online multilabel ranking,  online
  multilabel classification, and real-valued prediction with interval-valued response.'
