title: New Lower Bounds for Testing Monotonicity and Log Concavity of Distributions
section: Original Papers
abstract: " We develop a new technique for proving distribution testing lower bounds
  for properties defined by inequalities on the individual bin probabilities (such
  as monotonicity and log-concavity). The basic idea is to find a base distribution
  $Q$ where these inequalities barely hold in many places. We then find two different
  ensembles of distributions that modify $Q$ in slightly different ways. We use a
  moment matching construction so that each ensemble has the same bin moments (in
  particular the expectation over the choice of distribution $p$ of $p_{i}^t$ is the
  same for the two ensembles for small integers $t$). We show that this makes it impossible
  to distinguish between the two ensembles with a small number of samples. On the
  other hand, we construct them so that one ensemble will tweak Q in such a way that
  it may violate the defining inequalities of the property in question in many places,
  while the second ensembles does not. Since any valid tester for this property must
  be able to reliably distinguish these ensembles, we obtain a lower bound of testing
  the property. Roughly speaking, if we can construct Q which nearly violates the
  defining inequalities in n places and if the desired error $\\epilon$ is small enough
  relative to n, we hope to obtain a lower bound of roughly $\\frac{n}{\\epsilon^2}$
  up to log factors. In particular, we obtain a lower bound of $\\Omega( \\min(n,(1/\\epsilon)/
  \\log^3(1/\\epsilon))\\allowbreak / ( \\epsilon^2 \\log^7(1/\\epsilon)))$  for monotonicity
  testing on $[n]$ and $\\Omega(\\log^{-7}(1/\\epsilon) \\epsilon^{-2} \\min(n,\\epsilon^{-1/2}\\log^{-3/2}(1/\\epsilon)))$
  for log-concavity testing on $[n]$, the latter of which matches known upper bounds
  to within logarithmic factors. More generally, for monotonicity testing on $[n]^d$,
  we have the lower bound of $2^{-O(d)}d^{-d} \\epsilon^{-2} \\log^{-7}(1/\\epsilon)
  \\min(n,d \\epsilon^{-1} \\log^{-3}(1/\\epsilon))^d$."
