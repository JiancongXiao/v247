title: 'Counting Stars is Constant-Degree Optimal For Detecting Any Planted Subgraph:
  Extended Abstract'
section: Original Papers
abstract: We prove that whenever $p=\Omega(1)$ and for any graph $H$, counting $O(1)$-stars
  is optimal among all constant degree polynomial tests in terms of strongly separating
  an instance of $G(n,p),$ from the union of a random copy of $H$ with an instance
  of $G(n,p).$ Our work generalizes and extends multiple previous results on the inference
  abilities of $O(1)$-degree polynomials in the literature.
