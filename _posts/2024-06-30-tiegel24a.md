title: Improved Hardness Results for Learning Intersections of Halfspaces
section: Original Papers
abstract: We show strong (and surprisingly simple) lower bounds for weakly learning
  intersections of halfspaces in the improper setting. Strikingly little is known
  about this problem. For instance, it is not even known if there is a polynomial-time
  algorithm for learning the intersection of only two halfspaces. On the other hand,
  lower bounds based on well-established assumptions (such as approximating worst-case
  lattice problems or variants of Feige’s 3SAT hypothesis) are only known (or are
  implied by existing results) for the intersection of super-logarithmically many
  halfspaces (KS06, KS09, DS16). With intersections of fewer halfspaces being only
  ruled out under less standard assumptions (DV21) (such as the existence of local
  pseudo-random generators with large stretch). We significantly narrow this gap by
  showing that even learning $\omega(\log \log N)$ halfspaces in dimension $N$ takes
  super-polynomial time under standard assumptions on worst-case lattice problems
  (namely that SVP and SIVP are hard to approximate within polynomial factors). Further,
  we give unconditional hardness results in the statistical query framework. Specifically,
  we show that for any $k$ (even constant), learning $k$ halfspaces in dimension $N$
  requires accuracy $N^{-\Omega(k)}$, or exponentially many queries – in particular
  ruling out SQ algorithms with polynomial accuracy for $\omega(1)$ halfspaces. To
  the best of our knowledge this is the first unconditional hardness result for learning
  a super-constant number of halfspaces. Our lower bounds are obtained in a unified
  way via a novel connection we make between intersections of halfspaces and the so-called
  parallel pancakes distribution (DKS17, PLBR19, BRST21) that has been at the heart
  of many lower bound constructions in (robust)  high-dimensional statistics in the
  past few years.
