title: Some Constructions of Private, Efficient, and Optimal $K$-Norm and Elliptic
  Gaussian Noise
section: Original Papers
abstract: Differentially private computation often begins with a bound on some $d$-dimensional
  statistic’s $\ell_p$ sensitivity. For pure differential privacy, the $K$-norm mechanism
  can improve on this approach using a norm tailored to the statistic’s sensitivity
  space. Writing down a closed-form description of this optimal norm is often straightforward.
  However, running the $K$-norm mechanism reduces to uniformly sampling the norm’s
  unit ball; this ball is a $d$-dimensional convex body, so general sampling algorithms
  can be slow. Turning to concentrated differential privacy, elliptic Gaussian noise
  offers similar improvement over spherical Gaussian noise. Once the shape of this
  ellipse is determined, sampling is easy; however, identifying the best such shape
  may be hard. This paper solves both problems for the simple statistics of sum, count,
  and vote. For each statistic, we provide a sampler for the optimal $K$-norm mechanism
  that runs in time $\tilde O(d^2)$ and derive a closed-form expression for the optimal
  shape of elliptic Gaussian noise. The resulting algorithms all yield meaningful
  accuracy improvements while remaining fast and simple enough to be practical. More
  broadly, we suggest that problem-specific sensitivity space analysis may be an overlooked
  tool for private additive noise.
