title: Spatial properties of Bayesian unsupervised trees
section: Original Papers
abstract: Tree-based methods are popular nonparametric tools for capturing spatial
  heterogeneity and making predictions in multivariate problems. In unsupervised learning,
  trees and their ensembles have also been applied to a wide range of statistical
  inference tasks, such as multi-resolution sketching of distributional variations,
  localization of high-density regions, and design of efficient data compression schemes.
  In this paper, we study the spatial adaptation property of Bayesian tree-based methods
  in the unsupervised setting, with a focus on the density estimation problem. We
  characterize spatial heterogeneity of the underlying density function by using anisotropic
  Besov spaces, region-wise anisotropic Besov spaces, and two novel function classes
  as their extensions. For two types of commonly used prior distributions on trees
  under the context of unsupervised learning—the optional P{ó}lya tree (Wong and Ma,
  2010) and the Dirichlet prior (Lu et al., 2013)—we calculate posterior concentration
  rates when the density function exhibits different types of heterogeneity. In specific,
  we show that the posterior concentration rate for trees is near minimax over the
  anisotropic Besov space. The rate is adaptive in the sense that to achieve such
  a rate we do not need any prior knowledge of the parameters of the Besov space.
