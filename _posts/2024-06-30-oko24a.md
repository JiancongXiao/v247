title: 'Learning sum of diverse features: computational hardness and efficient gradient-based
  training for ridge combinations'
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study the statistical and computational complexity of learning a target
  function $f_*:\R^d\to\R$ with \textit{additive structure}, that is, $f_*(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}\sum_{m=1}^M
  f_m(⟨x, v_m⟩)$, where $f_1,f_2,...,f_M:\R\to\R$ are nonlinear link functions of
  single-index models (ridge functions) with diverse and near-orthogonal index features
  $\{v_m\}_{m=1}^M$, and the number of additive tasks $M$ grows with the dimensionality
  $M\asymp d^\gamma$ for $\gamma\ge 0$. This problem setting is motivated by the classical
  additive model literature, the recent representation learning theory of two-layer
  neural network, and large-scale pretraining where the model simultaneously acquires
  a large number of “skills” that are often \textit{localized} in distinct parts of
  the trained network. We prove that a large subset of polynomial $f_*$ can be efficiently
  learned by gradient descent training of a two-layer neural network, with a polynomial
  statistical and computational complexity that depends on the number of tasks $M$
  and the \textit{information exponent} of $f_m$, despite the unknown link function
  and $M$ growing with the dimensionality. We complement this learnability guarantee
  with computational hardness result by establishing statistical query (SQ) lower
  bounds for both the correlational SQ and full SQ algorithms.
