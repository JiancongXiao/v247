title: Low-degree phase transitions for detecting a planted clique in sublinear time
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We consider the problem of detecting a planted clique of size $k$ in a
  random graph on $n$ vertices.  When the size of the clique exceeds $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$,
  polynomial-time algorithms for detection proliferate.  We study faster—namely, sublinear
  time—algorithms in the high-signal regime when $k = \Theta(n^{1/2 + \delta})$, for
  some $\delta > 0$.  To this end, we consider algorithms that non-adaptively query
  a subset $M$ of entries of the adjacency matrix and then compute a low-degree polynomial
  function of the revealed entries.  We prove a computational phase transition for
  this class of \emph{non-adaptive low-degree algorithms}: under the scaling $\lvert
  M \rvert = \Theta(n^{\gamma})$, the clique can be detected when $\gamma > 3(1/2
  - \delta)$ but not when $\gamma < 3(1/2 - \delta)$. As a result, the best known
  runtime for detecting a planted clique, $\widetilde{O}(n^{3(1/2-\delta)})$, cannot
  be improved without looking beyond the non-adaptive low-degree class. Our proof
  of the lower bound—based on bounding the conditional low-degree likelihood ratio—reveals
  further structure in non-adaptive detection of a planted clique.  Using (a bound
  on) the conditional low-degree likelihood ratio as a potential function, we show
  that for \emph{every} non-adaptive query pattern, there is a highly structured query
  pattern of the same size that is at least as effective.'
