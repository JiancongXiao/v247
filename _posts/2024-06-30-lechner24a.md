title: Inherent limitations of dimensions for characterizing learnability of distribution
  classes
section: Original Papers
abstract: " We consider the long-standing question of finding a parameter of a class
  of probability distributions that characterizes its PAC learnability. While for
  many learning tasks (such as binary classification and online learning) there is
  a notion of dimension whose finiteness is equivalent to learnability within any
  level of accuracy, we show, rather surprisingly, that such parameter does not exist
  for distribution learning. Concretely, our results apply for several general notions
  of characterizing learnability and for several learning tasks. We show that there
  is no notion of dimension that characterizes the sample complexity of learning distribution
  classes. We then consider the weaker requirement of only characterizing learnability
  (rather than the quantitative sample complexity function). We propose some natural
  requirements for such a characterization and go on to show that there exists no
  characterization of learnability that satisfies these requirements for classes of
  distributions. Furthermore, we show that our results hold for various other learning
  problems. In particular, we show that there is no notion of dimension characterizing
  PAC-learnability for any of the tasks: classification learning w.r.t. a restricted
  set of marginal distributions and learnability of classes of real-valued functions
  with continuous losses."
