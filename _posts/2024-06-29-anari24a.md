title: Fast parallel sampling under isoperimetry
section: Original Papers
abstract: We show how to sample in parallel from a distribution $\pi$ over $\mathbb{R}^d$
  that satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality and has a smooth log-density, by parallelizing
  the Langevin (resp. underdamped Langevin) algorithms. We show that our algorithm
  outputs samples from a distribution $\hat{\pi}$ that is close to $\pi$ in Kullbackâ€“Leibler
  (KL) divergence (resp. total variation (TV) distance), while using only $\log(d)^{O(1)}$
  parallel rounds and $\widetilde{O}(d)$ (resp. $\widetilde O(\sqrt d)$) gradient
  evaluations in total. This constitutes the first parallel sampling algorithms with
  TV distance guarantees. For our main application, we show how to combine the TV
  distance guarantees of our algorithms with prior works and obtain RNC sampling-to-counting
  reductions for families of discrete distribution on the hypercube $\{\pm 1\}^n$  that
  are closed under exponential tilts and have bounded covariance. Consequently, we
  obtain an RNC sampler for directed Eulerian tours and asymmetric determinantal point
  processes, resolving open questions raised in prior works.
