title: 'Insufficient Statistics Perturbation: Stable Estimators for Private Least
  Squares Extended Abstract'
section: Original Papers
abstract: We present a sample- and time-efficient differentially private algorithm
  for ordinary least squares, with error that depends linearly on the dimension and
  is independent of the condition number of $X^\top X$, where $X$ is the design matrix.
  All prior private algorithms for this task require either $d^{3/2}$ examples, error
  growing polynomially with the condition number, or exponential time. Our near-optimal
  accuracy guarantee holds for any dataset with bounded statistical leverage and bounded
  residuals. Technically, we build on the approach of Brown et al. (2023) for private
  mean estimation, adding scaled noise to a carefully designed stable nonprivate estimator
  of the empirical regression vector.
