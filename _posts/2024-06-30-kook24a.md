title: Sampling from the Mean-Field Stationary Distribution
section: Original Papers
abstract: " We study the complexity of sampling from the stationary distribution of
  a mean-field SDE, or equivalently, the complexity of minimizing a functional over
  the space of probability measures which includes an interaction term. Our main insight
  is to decouple the two key aspects of this problem: (1) approximation of the mean-field
  SDE via a finite-particle system, via uniform-in-time propagation of chaos, and
  (2) sampling from the finite-particle stationary distribution, via standard log-concave
  samplers. Our approach is conceptually simpler and its flexibility allows for incorporating
  the state-of-the-art for both algorithms and theory. This leads to improved guarantees
  in numerous settings, including better guarantees for optimizing certain two-layer
  neural networks in the mean-field regime."
