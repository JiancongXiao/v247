title: Information-Theoretic Thresholds for the Alignments of Partially Correlated
  Graphs
section: Original Papers
abstract: This paper studies the problem of recovering the hidden vertex correspondence
  between two correlated random graphs. We propose the partially correlated Erdős-Rényi
  graphs model, wherein a pair of induced subgraphs with a certain number are correlated.
  We investigate the information-theoretic thresholds for recovering the latent correlated
  subgraphs and the hidden vertex correspondence. We prove that there exists an optimal
  rate for partial recovery for the number of correlated nodes, above which one can
  correctly match a fraction of vertices and below which correctly matching any positive
  fraction is impossible, and we also derive an optimal rate for exact recovery. In
  the proof of possibility results, we propose correlated functional digraphs, which
  categorize the edges of the intersection graph into two cases of components, and
  bound the error probability by lower-order cumulant generating functions. The proof
  of impossibility results build upon the generalized Fano’s inequality and the recovery
  thresholds settled in correlated Erdős-Rényi graphs model
