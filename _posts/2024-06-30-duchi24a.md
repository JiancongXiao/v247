title: An information-theoretic lower bound in time-uniform estimation
section: Original Papers
abstract: We present an information-theoretic lower bound for the problem of parameter
  estimation with time-uniform coverage guarantees. We use a reduction to sequential
  testing to obtain stronger lower bounds that capture the hardness of the time-uniform
  setting. In the case of location model estimation and logistic regression, our lower
  bound is $\Omega(\sqrt{n^{-1}\log \log n})$, which is tight up to constant factors
  in typical settings.
