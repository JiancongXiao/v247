title: 'Open problem: Convergence of single-timescale mean-field Langevin descent-ascent
  for two-player zero-sum games'
section: Open Problems
abstract: 'Let a smooth function $f: T^d \times T^d \to \mathbb{R}$ over the $d$-torus
  and $\beta>0$. Consider the min-max objective functional $F_\beta(\mu, \nu) = \iint
  f d\mu d\nu + \beta^{-1} H(\mu) - \beta^{-1} H(\nu)$ over $\mathcal{P}(T^d) \times
  \mathcal{P}(T^d)$, where $H$ denotes the negative differential entropy. Its unique
  saddle point defines the entropy-regularized mixed Nash equilibrium of a two-player
  zero-sum game, and its Wasserstein gradient descent-ascent flow $(\mu_t, \nu_t)$
  corresponds to the mean-field limit of a Langevin descent-ascent dynamics. Do $\mu_t$
  and $\nu_t$ converge (weakly, say) as $t \to \infty$, for any $f$ and $\beta$? This
  rather natural qualitative question is still open, and it is not clear whether it
  can be addressed using the tools currently available for the analysis of dynamics
  in Wasserstein space. Even though the simple trick of using a different timescale
  for the ascent versus the descent is known to guarantee convergence, we propose
  this question as a toy setting to further our understanding of the Wasserstein geometry
  for optimization.'
