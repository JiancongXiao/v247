title: A non-backtracking method for long matrix and tensor completion
section: Original Papers
abstract: ' We consider the problem of low-rank rectangular matrix completion in the
  regime where the matrix $M$  of size $n\times m$ is â€œlong", i.e., the aspect ratio
  $m/n$ diverges to infinity. Such matrices are of particular interest in the study
  of tensor completion, where they arise from the unfolding of a low-rank tensor.
  In the case where the sampling probability is $\frac{d}{\sqrt{mn}}$, we propose
  a new spectral algorithm for recovering the singular values and left singular vectors
  of the original matrix $M$ based on a variant of the standard non-backtracking operator
  of a suitably defined bipartite weighted random graph, which we call a \textit{non-backtracking
  wedge operator}. When $d$ is above a Kesten-Stigum-type sampling threshold, our
  algorithm recovers a correlated version of the singular value decomposition of $M$
  with quantifiable error bounds. This is the first result in the regime of bounded
  $d$ for weak recovery and the first for weak consistency when $d\to\infty$ arbitrarily
  slowly without any polylog factors. As an application, for low-CP-rank orthogonal
  $k$-tensor completion,  we efficiently achieve weak recovery with sample size $O(n^{k/2})$
  and weak consistency with sample size $\omega(n^{k/2})$. A similar result is obtained
  for low-multilinear-rank tensor completion with $O(n^{k/2})$ many samples.'
