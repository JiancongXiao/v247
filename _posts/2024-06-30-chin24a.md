abstract: 'Glauber dynamics are a natural model of dynamics of dependent systems.
  While originally introduced in statistical physics, they have found important applications
  in the study of social networks, computer vision and other domains.  In this work,
  we introduce a model of corrupted Glauber dynamics whereby instead of updating according
  to the prescribed conditional probabilities, some of the vertices and their updates
  are controlled by an adversary. We study the effect of such corruptions on global
  features of the system. Among the questions we study are: How many nodes need to
  be controlled in order to change the average statistics of the system in polynomial
  time? And how many nodes are needed to obstruct approximate convergence of the dynamics?
  Given a specific budget, how can the adversary choose nodes to control to maximize
  the overall effect? Our results can be viewed as studying the robustness of classical
  sampling methods and are thus related to robust inference. The proofs connect to
  classical theory of Glauber dynamics from statistical physics. '
