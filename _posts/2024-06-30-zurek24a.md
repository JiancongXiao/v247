title: 'Gap-Free Clustering: Sensitivity and Robustness of SDP'
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study graph clustering in the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) in the presence
  of both large clusters and small, unrecoverable clusters. Previous convex relaxation
  approaches achieving exact recovery do not allow any small clusters of size $o(\sqrt{n})$,
  or require a size gap between the smallest recovered cluster and the largest non-recovered
  cluster. We provide an algorithm based on semidefinite programming (SDP) which removes
  these requirements and provably recovers large clusters regardless of the remaining
  cluster sizes. Mid-sized clusters pose unique challenges to the analysis, since
  their proximity to the recovery threshold makes them highly sensitive to small noise
  perturbations and precludes a closed-form candidate solution. We develop novel techniques,
  including a leave-one-out-style argument which controls the correlation between
  SDP solutions and noise vectors even when the removal of one row of noise can drastically
  change the SDP solution. We also develop improved eigenvalue perturbation bounds
  of potential independent interest. Our results are robust to certain semirandom
  settings that are challenging for alternative algorithms. Using our gap-free clustering
  procedure, we obtain efficient algorithms for the problem of clustering with a faulty
  oracle with superior query complexities, notably achieving $o(n^2)$ sample complexity
  even in the presence of a large number of small clusters. Our gap-free clustering
  procedure also leads to improved algorithms for recursive clustering.
