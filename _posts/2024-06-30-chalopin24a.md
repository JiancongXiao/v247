title: Non-Clashing Teaching Maps for Balls in Graphs
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Recently, Kirkpatrick et al. [ALT 2019] and  Fallat et al. [JMLR 2023]
  introduced non-clashing teaching and showed it to be the most efficient machine
  teaching model satisfying the benchmark for collusion-avoidance set by Goldman and
  Mathias. A teaching map $T$ for a concept class $\mathcal{C}$ assigns a (teaching)
  set $T(C)$ of examples to each concept $C \in \mathcal{C}$. A teaching map is non-clashing
  if no pair of concepts are consistent with the union of their teaching sets. The
  size of a non-clashing teaching map (NCTM) $T$ is the maximum size of a teaching
  set $T(C)$, $C \in \mathcal{C}$. The non-clashing teaching dimension $NCTD(\mathcal{C})$
  of $\mathcal{C}$ is the minimum size of an NCTM for $\mathcal{C}$. NCTM$^+$ and
  NCTD$^+(\mathcal{C})$ are defined analogously, except the teacher may only use positive
  examples. We study NCTMs and NCTM$^+$s for the concept class $\mathcal{B}(G)$ consisting
  of all balls of a graph $G$. We show that the associated decision problem \textsc{B-NCTD$^+$}
  for NCTD$^+$ is \textsf{NP}-complete in split, co-bipartite, and bipartite graphs.
  Surprisingly, we even prove that, unless the \textsf{ETH} fails, \textsc{B-NCTD$^+$}
  does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(\mathtt{vc})}}\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$,
  nor a kernelization algorithm outputting a kernel with $2^{o(\mathtt{vc})}$ vertices,
  where $\mathtt{vc}$ is the vertex cover number of $G$. These are extremely rare
  results: it is only the second (fourth, resp.) problem in \textsf{NP} to admit such
  a double-exponential lower bound parameterized by $\mathtt{vc}$ (treewidth, resp.),
  and only one of very few problems to admit such an \textsf{ETH}-based conditional
  lower bound on the number of vertices in a kernel. We complement these lower bounds
  with matching upper bounds. For trees, interval graphs, cycles, and trees of cycles,
  we derive NCTM$^+$s or NCTMs for $\mathcal{B}(G)$ of size proportional to its VC-dimension.
  For Gromov-hyperbolic graphs, we design an approximate NCTM$^+$ for $\mathcal{B}(G)$
  of size $2$, in which only pairs of balls with Hausdorff distance larger than some
  constant must satisfy the non-clashing condition.'
