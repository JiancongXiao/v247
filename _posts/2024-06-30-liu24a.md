title: The role of randomness in quantum state certification with unentangled measurements
section: Original Papers
abstract: Given $n$ copies of an unknown quantum state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times
  d}$, quantum state certification is the task of determining whether $\rho=\rho_0$
  or $\|\rho-\rho_0\|_1>\varepsilon$, where $\rho_0$ is a known reference state. We
  study quantum state certification using unentangled quantum measurements, namely
  measurements which operate only on one copy of $\rho$ at a time. When there is a
  common source of randomness available and the unentangled measurements are chosen
  based on this randomness, prior work has shown that $\Theta(d^{3/2}/\varepsilon^2)$
  copies are necessary and sufficient. This holds even when the measurements are allowed
  to be chosen adaptively. We consider deterministic measurement schemes (as opposed
  to randomized) and demonstrate that ${\Theta}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary
  and sufficient for state certification. This shows a separation between algorithms
  with and without randomness.  We develop a lower bound framework for both fixed
  and randomized measurements that relates the hardness of testing to the well-established
  Lüders rule. More precisely, we obtain lower bounds for randomized and fixed schemes
  as a function of the eigenvalues of the Lüders channel which characterizes one possible
  post-measurement state transformation.
