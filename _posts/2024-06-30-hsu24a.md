title: On the sample complexity of parameter estimation in logistic regression with
  normal design
section: Original Papers
abstract: The logistic regression model is one of the most popular data generation
  model in noisy binary classification problems. In this work, we study the sample
  complexity of estimating the parameters of the logistic regression model up to a
  given $\ell_2$ error, in terms of the dimension and the inverse temperature, with
  standard normal covariates. The inverse temperature controls the signal-to-noise
  ratio of the data generation process. While both generalization bounds and asymptotic
  performance of the maximum-likelihood estimator for logistic regression are well-studied,
  the non-asymptotic sample complexity that shows the dependence on error and the
  inverse temperature for parameter estimation is absent from previous analyses. We
  show that the sample complexity curve has two change-points in terms of the inverse
  temperature, clearly separating the low, moderate, and high temperature regimes.
