title: Simple online learning with consistent oracle
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We consider online learning in the model where a learning algorithm can
  access the class only via the \emph{consistent oracle}—an oracle, that, at any moment,
  can give a function from the class that agrees with all examples seen so far. This
  model was recently considered by Assos et al. (COLT’23). It is motivated by the
  fact that standard methods of online learning rely on computing the Littlestone
  dimension of subclasses, a computationally intractable problem. Assos et al. gave
  an online learning algorithm in this model that makes at most $C^d$ mistakes on
  classes of Littlestone dimension $d$, for some absolute unspecified constant $C
  > 0$. We give a novel algorithm that makes at most $O(256^d)$ mistakes. Our proof
  is significantly simpler and uses only very basic properties of the Littlestone
  dimension. We also show that there exists no algorithm in this model that makes
  less than $3^d$ mistakes. Our algorithm (as well as the algorithm of Assos et al.)
  solves an open problem by Hasrati and Ben-David (ALT’23). Namely, it demonstrates
  that every class of finite Littlestone dimension with recursively enumerable representation
  admits a computable online learner (that may be undefined on unrealizable samples). '
