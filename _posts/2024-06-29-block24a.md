title: On the Performance of Empirical Risk Minimization with Smoothed Data
section: Original Papers
abstract: In order to circumvent statistical and computational hardness results in
  sequential decision-making, recent work has considered smoothed online learning,
  where the distribution of data at each time is assumed to have bounded likeliehood
  ratio with respect to a base measure when conditioned on the history.   While previous
  works have demonstrated the benefits of smoothness, they have either assumed that
  the base measure is known to the learner or have presented computationally inefficient
  algorithms applying only in special cases.  This work investigates the more general
  setting where the base measure is \emph{unknown} to the learner, focusing in particular
  on the performance of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) with square loss when the
  data are well-specified and smooth.   We show that in this setting, ERM is able
  to achieve sublinear error whenever a class is learnable with iid data; in particular,
  ERM achieves error scaling as $\tilde O( \sqrt{\mathrm{comp}(\mathcal F) \cdot T}
  )$, where $\mathrm{comp}(\mathcal{F})$ is the statistical complexity of learning
  $\mathcal F$ with iid data.   In so doing, we prove a novel norm comparison bound
  for smoothed data that comprises the first sharp norm comparison for dependent data
  applying to arbitrary, nonlinear function classes. We complement these results with
  a lower bound indicating that our analysis of ERM is essentially tight, establishing
  a separation in the performance of ERM between smoothed and iid data.
