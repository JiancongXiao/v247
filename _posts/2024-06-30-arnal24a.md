title: Mode Estimation with Partial Feedback
section: Original Papers
abstract: " The combination of lightly supervised pre-training and online fine-tuning
  has played a key role in recent AI developments. These new learning pipelines call
  for new theoretical frameworks. In this paper, we formalize key aspects of weakly
  supervised and active learning with a simple problem: the estimation of the mode
  of a distribution with partial feedback. We showcase how entropy coding allows for
  optimal information acquisition from partial feedback, develop coarse sufficient
  statistics for mode identification, and adapt bandit algorithms to our new setting.
  Finally, we combine those contributions into a statistically and computationally
  efficient solution to our original problem. "
