title: Fundamental Limits of Non-Linear Low-Rank Matrix Estimation
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We consider the task of estimating a low-rank matrix from non-linear and
  noisy observations. We prove a strong universality result showing that Bayes-optimal
  performances are characterized by an equivalent Gaussian model with an effective
  prior, whose parameters are entirely determined by an expansion of the non-linear
  function.  In particular, we show that to reconstruct the signal accurately, one
  requires a signal-to-noise ratio growing as \(N^{\frac 12 (1-1/k_F)}\), where \(k_F\){is}
  the first non-zero Fisher information coefficient of the function.  We provide asymptotic
  characterization for the minimal achievable mean squared error (MMSE) and an approximate
  message-passing algorithm that reaches the MMSE under conditions analogous to the
  linear version of the problem.  We also provide asymptotic errors achieved by methods
  such as principal component analysis combined with Bayesian denoising, and compare
  them with Bayes-optimal MMSE. '
