title: Active Learning with Simple Questions
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We consider an active learning setting where a learner is presented with
  a pool $S$ of $n$ unlabeled examples belonging to a domain $\mathcal X$ and asks
  queries to find the underlying labeling that agrees with a target concept $h^\ast
  \in \mathcal H$.  In contrast to traditional active learning that queries a single
  example for its label, we study more general \emph{region queries} that allow the
  learner to pick a subset of the domain $T \subset \mathcal X$ and a target label
  $y$ and ask a labeler whether $h^\ast(x) = y $ for every example in the set $T \cap
  S$. Such more powerful queries allow us to bypass the limitations of traditional
  active learning and use significantly fewer rounds of interactions to learn but
  can potentially lead to a significantly more complex query language. Our main contribution
  is quantifying the trade-off between the number of queries and the complexity of
  the query language used by the learner. We measure the complexity of the region
  queries via the VC dimension of the family of regions. We show that given any hypothesis
  class $\H$ with VC dimension $d$, one can design a region query family $Q$ with
  VC dimension $6d$ such that for every set of $n$ examples $S \subset \X$ and every
  $h^* \in \H$, a learner can submit $O(d\log n)$ queries from $Q$ to a labeler and
  perfectly label $S$. We show a matching lower bound by designing a hypothesis class
  $\H$ with VC dimension $d$ and a dataset $S \subset \X$ of size $n$ such that any
  learning algorithm using any query class with VC dimension $(d-2)/3$ must make $\poly(n)$
  queries to label $S$ perfectly. Finally, we focus on well-studied hypothesis classes
  including unions of intervals, high-dimensional boxes, and $d$-dimensional halfspaces,
  and obtain stronger results. In particular, we design learning algorithms that (i)
  are computationally efficient and (ii) work even when the queries are not answered
  based on the learnerâ€™s pool of examples $S$ but on some unknown superset $L$ of
  $S$. '
