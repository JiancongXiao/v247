  convergence'
section: Original Papers
abstract: Many algorithms for high-dimensional regression problems require the calibration
  of regularization hyperparameters. This, in turn, often requires the knowledge of
  the unknown noise variance in order to produce meaningful solutions. Recent works
  show, however, that there exist certain estimators that are pivotal, i.e., the regularization
  parameter does not depend on the noise level; the most remarkable example being
  the square-root lasso. Such estimators have also been shown to exhibit strong connections
  to distributionally robust optimization. Despite the progress in the design of pivotal
  estimators, the resulting minimization problem is challenging as both the loss function
  and the regularization term are non-smooth. To date, the design of fast, robust,
  and scalable algorithms with strong convergence rate guarantees is still an open
  problem. This work addresses this problem by showing that an iteratively reweighted
  least squares (IRLS) algorithm exhibits global linear convergence under the weakest
  assumption available in the literature. We expect our findings will also have implications
  for multi-task learning and distributionally robust optimization.
