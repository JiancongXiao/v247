title: On the Distance from Calibration in Sequential Prediction
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study a sequential binary prediction setting where the forecaster is
  evaluated in terms of the calibration distance, which is defined as the $L_1$ distance
  between the predicted values and the set of predictions that are perfectly calibrated
  in hindsight. This is analogous to a calibration measure recently proposed by BÅ‚{}asiok,
  Gopalan, Hu and Nakkiran (STOC 2023) for the offline setting. The calibration distance
  is a natural and intuitive measure of deviation from perfect calibration, and satisfies
  a Lipschitz continuity property which does not hold for many popular calibration
  measures, such as the $L_1$ calibration error and its variants. We prove that there
  is a forecasting algorithm that achieves an $O(\sqrt{T})$ calibration distance in
  expectation on an adversarially chosen sequence of $T$ binary outcomes. At the core
  of this upper bound is a structural result showing that the calibration distance
  is accurately approximated by the lower calibration distance, which is a continuous
  relaxation of the former. We then show that an $O(\sqrt{T})$ lower calibration distance
  can be achieved via a simple minimax argument and a reduction to online learning
  on a Lipschitz class. On the lower bound side, an $\Omega(T^{1/3})$ calibration
  distance is shown to be unavoidable, even when the adversary outputs a sequence
  of independent random bits, and has an additional ability to early stop (i.e., to
  stop producing random bits and output the same bit in the remaining steps). Interestingly,
  without this early stopping, the forecaster can achieve a much smaller calibration
  distance of $\mathrm{polylog}(T)$.
