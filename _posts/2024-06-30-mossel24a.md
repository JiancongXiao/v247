title: Finding Super-spreaders in Network Cascades
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Suppose that a cascade (e.g., an epidemic) spreads on an unknown graph,
  and only the infection times of vertices are observed. What can be learned about
  the graph from the infection times caused by multiple distinct cascades? Most of
  the literature on this topic focuses on the task of recovering the \emph{entire}
  graph, which requires $\Omega ( \log n)$ cascades for an $n$-vertex bounded degree
  graph. Here we ask a different question: can the important parts of the graph be
  estimated from just a few (i.e., constant number) of cascades, even as $n$ grows
  large? In this work, we focus on identifying super-spreaders (i.e., high-degree
  vertices) from infection times caused by a Susceptible-Infected process on a graph.
  Our first main result shows that vertices of degree greater than $n^{3/4}$ can indeed
  be estimated from a constant number of cascades. Our algorithm for doing so leverages
  a novel connection between vertex degrees and the second derivative of the cumulative
  infection curve. Conversely, we show that estimating vertices of degree smaller
  than $n^{1/2}$ requires at least $\log(n) / \log \log (n)$ cascades. Surprisingly,
  this matches (up to $\log \log n$ factors) the number of cascades needed to learn
  the \emph{entire} graph if it is a tree.'
