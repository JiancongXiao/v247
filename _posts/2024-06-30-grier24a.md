title: Principal eigenstate classical shadows
section: Original Papers
abstract: Given many copies of an unknown quantum state $\rho$, we consider the task
  of learning a classical description of its principal eigenstate. Namely, assuming
  that $\rho$ has an eigenstate $|\phi⟩$ with (unknown) eigenvalue $\lambda > 1/2$,
  the goal is to learn a (classical shadows style) classical description of $|\phi⟩$
  which can later be used to estimate expectation values $⟨\phi |O | \phi ⟩$ for any
  $O$ in some class of observables. We consider the sample-complexity setting in which
  generating a copy of $\rho$ is expensive, but joint measurements on many copies
  of the state are possible. We present a protocol for this task scaling with the
  principal eigenvalue $\lambda$ and show that it is optimal within a space of natural
  approaches, e.g., applying quantum state purification followed by a single-copy
  classical shadows scheme. Furthermore, when $\lambda$ is sufficiently close to $1$,
  the performance of our algorithm is optimal—matching the sample complexity for pure
  state classical shadows.
