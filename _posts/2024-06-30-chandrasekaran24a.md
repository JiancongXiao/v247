title: Smoothed Analysis for Learning Concepts with Low Intrinsic Dimension
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'In the well-studied agnostic model of learning, the goal of a learner–
  given examples from an arbitrary joint distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d \times \{\pm
  1\}$– is to output a hypothesis that is competitive (to within $\epsilon$) of the
  best fitting concept from some class.  In order to escape strong hardness results
  for learning even simple concept classes in this model, we introduce a smoothed
  analysis framework where we require a learner to compete only with the best classifier
  that is robust to small random Gaussian perturbation. This subtle change allows
  us to give a wide array of learning results for any concept that (1) depends on
  a low-dimensional subspace (aka multi-index model) and (2) has a bounded Gaussian
  surface area.  This class includes functions of halfspaces and (low-dimensional)
  convex sets, cases that are only known to be learnable in non-smoothed settings
  with respect to highly structured distributions such as Gaussians. Perhaps surprisingly,
  our analysis also yields new results for traditional non-smoothed frameworks such
  as learning with margin.  In particular, we obtain the first algorithm for agnostically
  learning intersections of $k$-halfspaces in time  $k^{\poly(\frac{\log k}{\epsilon
  \gamma}) }$ where $\gamma$ is the margin parameter.   Before our work, the best-known
  runtime was exponential in $k$ (Arriaga and Vempala, 1999). '
