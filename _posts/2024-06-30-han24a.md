title: Prediction from compression for models with infinite memory, with applications
  to hidden Markov and renewal processes
section: Original Papers
abstract: Consider the problem of predicting the next symbol given a sample path of
  length $n$, whose joint distribution belongs to a distribution class that may have
  long-term memory. The goal is to compete with the conditional predictor that knows
  the true model. For both hidden Markov models (HMMs) and renewal processes, we determine
  the optimal prediction risk in Kullback-Leibler divergence up to universal constant
  factors.  Extending existing results in finite-order Markov models (Han et al. (2023))
  and drawing ideas from universal compression, the proposed estimator has a prediction
  risk bounded by redundancy of the distribution class and a memory term that accounts
  for the long-range dependency of the model. Notably, for HMMs with bounded state
  and observation spaces, a polynomial-time estimator based on dynamic programming
  is shown to achieve the optimal prediction risk $\Theta(\frac{\log n}{n})$; prior
  to this work, the only known result of this type is $O(\frac{1}{\log n})$ obtained
  using Markov approximation (Sharan et al. (2018)). Matching minimax lower bounds
  are obtained by making connections to redundancy and mutual information via a reduction
  argument.
