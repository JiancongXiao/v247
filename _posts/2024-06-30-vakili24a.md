title: 'Open Problem: Order Optimal Regret Bounds for Kernel-Based Reinforcement Learning'
section: Open Problems
abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great empirical success in various
  application domains. The theoretical aspects of the problem have been extensively
  studied over past decades, particularly under tabular and linear Markov Decision
  Process structures. Recently, non-linear function approximation using kernel-based
  prediction has gained traction. This approach is particularly interesting as it
  naturally extends the linear structure, and helps explain the behavior of neural-network-based
  models at their infinite width limit. The analytical results however do not adequately
  address the performance guarantees for this case. We will highlight this open problem,
  overview existing partial results, and discuss related challenges.
