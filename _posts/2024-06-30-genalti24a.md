title: "$(ε, u)$-Adaptive Regret Minimization in Heavy-Tailed Bandits"
section: Original Papers
abstract: Heavy-tailed distributions naturally arise in several settings, from finance
  to telecommunications. While regret minimization under subgaussian or bounded rewards
  has been widely studied, learning with heavy-tailed distributions only gained popularity
  over the last decade. In this paper, we consider the setting in which the reward
  distributions have finite absolute raw moments of maximum order $1+\epsilon$, uniformly
  bounded by a constant $u<+\infty$, for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. In this setting,
  we study the regret minimization problem when $\epsilon$ and $u$ are unknown to
  the learner and it has to adapt. First, we show that adaptation comes at a cost
  and derive two negative results proving that the same regret guarantees of the non-adaptive
  case cannot be achieved with no further assumptions. Then, we devise and analyze
  a fully data-driven trimmed mean estimator and propose a novel adaptive regret minimization
  algorithm, \texttt{AdaR-UCB}, that leverages such an estimator. Finally, we show
  that \texttt{AdaR-UCB} is the first algorithm that, under a known distributional
  assumption, enjoys regret guarantees nearly matching those of the non-adaptive heavy-tailed
  case.
