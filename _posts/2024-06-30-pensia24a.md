title: The Sample Complexity of Simple Binary Hypothesis Testing
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'The sample complexity of simple binary hypothesis testing is the smallest
  number of i.i.d. samples required to distinguish between two distributions $p$ and
  $q$ in either: (i) the prior-free setting, with type-I error at most $\alpha$ and
  type-II error at most $\beta$; or (ii) the Bayesian setting, with Bayes error at
  most $\delta$ and prior distribution $(\alpha, 1-\alpha)$. This problem has only
  been studied when $\alpha = \beta$ (prior-free) or $\alpha = 1/2$ (Bayesian), and
  the sample complexity is known to be characterized by the Hellinger divergence between
  $p$ and $q$, up to multiplicative constants. In this paper, we derive a formula
  that characterizes the sample complexity (up to multiplicative constants that are
  independent of $p$, $q$, and all error parameters) for: (i) all $0 \le \alpha, \beta
  \le 1/8$ in the prior-free setting; and (ii) all $\delta \le \alpha/4$ in the Bayesian
  setting. In particular, the formula admits equivalent expressions in terms of certain
  divergences from the Jensen–Shannon and Hellinger families. The main technical result
  concerns an $f$-divergence inequality between members of the Jensen–Shannon and
  Hellinger families, which is proved by a combination of information-theoretic tools
  and case-by-case analyses. We explore applications of our results to robust and
  distributed (locally-private and communication-constrained) hypothesis testing.'
