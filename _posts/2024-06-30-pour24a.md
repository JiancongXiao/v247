title: Sample-Optimal Locally Private Hypothesis Selection and the Provable Benefits
  of Interactivity
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study the problem of hypothesis selection under the constraint of local
  differential privacy. Given a class $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$ distributions and a set
  of i.i.d. samples from an unknown distribution $h$, the goal of hypothesis selection
  is to pick a distribution $\hat{f}$ whose total variation distance to $h$ is comparable
  with the best distribution in $\mathcal{F}$ (with high probability). We devise an
  $\varepsilon$-locally-differentially-private ($\varepsilon$-LDP) algorithm that
  uses $\Theta\left(\frac{k}{\alpha^2\min \{\varepsilon^2,1\}}\right)$ samples to
  guarantee that $d_{TV}(h,\hat{f})\leq \alpha + 9 \min_{f\in \mathcal{F}}d_{TV}(h,f)$
  with high probability. This sample complexity is optimal for $varepsilon<1$, matching
  the lower bound of Gopi et al. (2020). All previously known algorithms for this
  problem required $\Omega\left(\frac{k\log k}{\alpha^2\min \{\varepsilon^2 ,1\}}
  \right)$ samples to work.  Moreover, our result demonstrates the power of interaction
  for $\varepsilon$-LDP hypothesis selection. Namely, it breaks the known lower bound
  of $\Omega\left(\frac{k\log k}{\alpha^2 \varepsilon^2} \right)$ for the sample complexity
  of non-interactive hypothesis selection. Our algorithm achieves this using only
  $\Theta(\log \log k)$ rounds of interaction. To prove our results, we define the
  notion of \emph{critical queries} for a Statistical Query Algorithm (SQA) which
  may be of independent interest. Informally, an SQA is said to use a small number
  of critical queries if its success relies on the accuracy of only a small number
  of queries it asks. We then design an LDP algorithm that uses a smaller number of
  critical queries.
