title: Algorithms for mean-field variational inference via polyhedral optimization
  in the Wasserstein space
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We develop a theory of finite-dimensional polyhedral subsets over the Wasserstein
  space and optimization of functionals over them via first-order methods.  Our main
  application is to the problem of mean-field variational inference, which seeks to
  approximate a distribution $\pi$ over $\mathbb{R}^d$ by a product measure $\pi^\star$.
  When $\pi$ is strongly log-concave and log-smooth, we provide (1) approximation
  rates certifying that $\pi^\star$ is close to the minimizer $\pi^\star_\diamond$
  of the KL divergence over a \emph{polyhedral} set $\mathcal{P}_\diamond$, and (2)
  an algorithm for minimizing $\text{KL}(\cdot\|\pi)$ over $\mathcal{P}_\diamond$
  with accelerated complexity $O(\sqrt \kappa \log(\kappa d/\varepsilon^2))$, where
  $\kappa$ is the condition number of $\pi$. '
