title: Adversarial Online Learning with Temporal Feedback Graphs
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study a variant of prediction with expert advice where the learner’s
  action at round $t$ is only allowed to depend on losses on a specific subset of
  the rounds (where the structure of which rounds’ losses are visible at time $t$
  is provided by a directed “feedback graph” known to the learner). We present a novel
  learning algorithm for this setting based on a strategy of partitioning the losses
  across sub-cliques of this graph. We complement this with a lower bound that is
  tight in many practical settings, and which we conjecture to be within a constant
  factor of optimal. For the important class of transitive feedback graphs, we prove
  that this algorithm is efficiently implementable and obtains the optimal regret
  bound (up to a universal constant).
