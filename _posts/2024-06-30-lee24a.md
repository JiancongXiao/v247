  in Adversarial Bandits and Best-of-Both-Worlds'
section: Original Papers
abstract: This paper studies the optimality of the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL)
  policy in both adversarial and stochastic $K$-armed bandits. Despite the widespread
  use of the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework with various choices of
  regularization, the FTPL framework, which relies on random perturbations, has not
  received much attention, despite its inherent simplicity. In adversarial bandits,
  there has been conjecture that FTPL could potentially achieve $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{KT})$
  regrets if perturbations follow a distribution with a Fréchet-type tail. Recent
  work by Honda et al. (2023) showed that FTPL with Fréchet distribution with shape
  $\alpha=2$ indeed attains this bound and, notably logarithmic regret in stochastic
  bandits, meaning the Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) capability of FTPL. However, this
  result only partly resolves the above conjecture because their analysis heavily
  relies on the specific form of the Fréchet distribution with this shape. In this
  paper, we establish a sufficient condition for perturbations to achieve $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{KT})$
  regrets in the adversarial setting, which covers, e.g., Fréchet, Pareto, and Student-$t$
  distributions. We also demonstrate the BOBW achievability of FTPL with certain Fréchet-type
  tail distributions.  Our results contribute not only to resolving existing conjectures
  through the lens of extreme value theory but also potentially offer insights into
  the effect of the regularization functions in FTRL through the mapping from FTPL
  to FTRL.
