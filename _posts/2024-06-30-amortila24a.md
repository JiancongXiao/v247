title: Mitigating Covariate Shift in Misspecified Regression with Applications to
  Reinforcement Learning
section: Original Papers
abstract: A pervasive phenomenon in machine learning applications is \emph{distribution
  shift}, where training and deployment conditions for a machine learning model differ.
  As distribution shift typically results in a degradation in performance, much attention
  has been devoted to algorithmic interventions that mitigate these detrimental effects.
  This paper studies the effect of distribution shift in the presence of model misspecification,
  specifically focusing on $L_{\infty}$-misspecified regression and \emph{adversarial
  covariate shift}, where the regression target remains fixed while the covariate
  distribution changes arbitrarily. We show that empirical risk minimization, or standard
  least squares regression, can result in undesirable \emph{misspecification amplification}
  where the error due to misspecification is amplified by the density ratio between
  the training and testing distributions. As our main result, we develop a new algorithm—inspired
  by robust optimization techniques—that avoids this undesirable behavior, resulting
  in no misspecification amplification while still obtaining optimal statistical rates.
  As applications, we use this regression procedure to obtain new guarantees in offline
  and online reinforcement learning with misspecification and establish new separations
  between previously studied structural conditions and notions of coverage.
