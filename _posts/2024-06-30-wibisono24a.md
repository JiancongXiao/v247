title: Optimal score estimation via empirical Bayes smoothing
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study the problem of estimating the score function of an unknown probability
  distribution $\rho^*$ from $n$ independent and identically distributed observations
  in $d$ dimensions. Assuming that $\rho^*$ is subgaussian and has a Lipschitz-continuous
  score function $s^*$, we establish the optimal rate of $\tilde \Theta(n^{-\frac{2}{d+4}})$
  for this estimation problem under the loss function $\|\hat s - s^*\|^2_{L^2(\rho^*)}$
  that is commonly used in the score matching literature, highlighting the curse of
  dimensionality where sample complexity for accurate score estimation grows exponentially
  with the dimension $d$. Leveraging key insights in empirical Bayes theory as well
  as a new convergence rate of smoothed empirical distribution in Hellinger distance,
  we show that a regularized score estimator based on a Gaussian kernel attains this
  rate, shown optimal by a matching minimax lower bound. We also discuss extensions
  to estimating $\beta$-HÃ¶lder continuous scores with $\beta \leq 1$, as well as the
  implication of our theory on the sample complexity of score-based generative models.
