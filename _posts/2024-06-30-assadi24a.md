title: 'The Best Arm Evades: Near-optimal Multi-pass Streaming Lower Bounds for Pure
  Exploration in Multi-armed Bandits'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We give a near-optimal sample-pass trade-off for pure exploration in multi-armed
  bandits (MABs) via multi-pass streaming algorithms: any streaming algorithm with
  sublinear memory that uses the optimal sample complexity of $O(n/\Delta^2)$ requires
  $\Omega(\log{(1/\Delta)}/\log\log{(1/\Delta)})$ passes. Here, $n$ is the number
  of arms and $\Delta$ is the reward gap between the best and the second-best arms.
  Our result matches the $O(\log(1/\Delta))$ pass algorithm of Jin et al. [ICML’21]
  (up to lower order terms) that only uses $O(1)$ memory and answers an open question
  posed by Assadi and Wang [STOC’20].'
