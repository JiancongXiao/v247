title: Faster Spectral Density Estimation and Sparsification in the Nuclear Norm (Extended
  Abstract)
section: Original Papers
abstract: " We consider the problem of estimating the spectral density of a normalized
  graph adjacency matrix. Concretely, given an undirected graph $G = (V, E, w)$ with
  $n$ nodes and positive edge weights $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{E}_{> 0}$, the goal is
  to return eigenvalue estimates $\\widehat{\\lambda}_1 \\le \\cdots\\le \\widehat{\\lambda}_n$
  such that \\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i\\in\\{1,\\ldots, n\\}}|\\widehat{\\lambda}_i-\\lambda_i(N_G)|\\le
  \\varepsilon, \\end{align*} where ${\\lambda}_1(N_G)\\le \\cdots\\le{\\lambda}_n(N_G)$
  are the eigenvalues of $G$â€™s normalized adjacency matrix, $N_G$. This goal is equivalent
  to requiring that the Wasserstein-1 distance between the uniform distribution on
  $\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_n$ and the uniform distribution on $\\widehat{\\lambda}_1,
  \\ldots, \\widehat{\\lambda}_n$ is less than $\\varepsilon$. We provide a randomized
  algorithm that achieves the guarantee above with $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$ queries
  to a degree and neighbor oracle and in $O(n\\varepsilon^{-3})$ time. This improves
  on previous state-of-the-art methods, including an $O(n\\varepsilon^{-7})$ time
  algorithm from [Braverman et al., STOC 2022] and, for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon$,
  a $2^{O(\\varepsilon^{-1})}$ time method from [Cohen-Steiner et al., KDD 2018].
  To achieve this result, we introduce a new notion of graph sparsification, which
  we call \\emph{nuclear sparsification}. We provide an $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$-query
  and $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$-time algorithm for computing $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$-sparse
  nuclear sparsifiers. We show that this bound is optimal in both its sparsity and
  query complexity, and we separate our results from the related notion of additive
  spectral sparsification. Of independent interest, we show that our sparsification
  method also yields the first \\emph{deterministic} algorithm for spectral density
  estimation that scales linearly with $n$ (sublinear in the representation size of
  the graph)."
