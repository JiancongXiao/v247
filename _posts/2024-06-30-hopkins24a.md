title: Adversarially-Robust Inference on Trees via Belief Propagation
section: Original Papers
abstract: We introduce and study the problem of posterior inference on tree-structured
  graphical models in the presence of a malicious adversary who can corrupt some observed
  nodes. In the well-studied \emph{broadcasting on trees} model, corresponding to
  the ferromagnetic Ising model on a $d$-regular tree with zero external field, when
  a natural signal-to-noise ratio exceeds one (the celebrated \emph{Kesten-Stigum
  threshold}), the posterior distribution of the root given the leaves is bounded
  away from $\mathrm{Ber}(1/2)$, and carries nontrivial information about the sign
  of the root. This posterior distribution can be computed exactly via dynamic programming,
  also known as belief propagation. We first confirm a folklore belief that a malicious
  adversary who can corrupt an inverse-polynomial fraction of the leaves of their
  choosing makes this inference impossible. Our main result is that accurate posterior
  inference about the root vertex given the leaves \emph{is} possible when the adversary
  is constrained to make corruptions at a $\rho$-fraction of randomly-chosen leaf
  vertices, so long as the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds $O(\log d)$ and $\rho \leq
  c \varepsilon$ for some universal $c > 0$. Since inference becomes information-theoretically
  impossible when $\rho \gg \varepsilon$, this amounts to an information-theoretically
  optimal fraction of corruptions, up to a constant multiplicative factor. Furthermore,
  we show that the canonical belief propagation algorithm performs this inference.
