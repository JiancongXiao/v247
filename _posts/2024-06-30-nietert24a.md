title: Robust Distribution Learning with Local and Global Adversarial Corruptions
  (extended abstract)
section: Original Papers
abstract: We consider learning in an adversarial environment, where an $\varepsilon$-fraction
  of samples from a distribution $P$ are arbitrarily modified (\emph{global} corruptions)
  and the remaining perturbations have average magnitude bounded by $\rho$ (\emph{local}
  corruptions). Given access to $n$ such corrupted samples, we seek a computationally
  efficient estimator $\hat{P}_n$ that  minimizes the Wasserstein distance $W_1(\hat{P}_n,P)$.
  In fact, we attack the fine-grained task of minimizing $W_1(\Pi_\sharp  \hat{P}_n,
  \Pi_\sharp P)$ for all orthogonal projections $\Pi \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$,
  with performance scaling with $\mathrm{rank}(\Pi) = k$. This allows us to account
  simultaneously for mean estimation ($k=1$), distribution estimation ($k=d$), as
  well as the settings interpolating between these two extremes. We characterize the
  optimal population-limit risk for this task and then develop an efficient finite-sample
  algorithm with error bounded by $\sqrt{\varepsilon k} + \rho + \tilde{O}(k\sqrt{d}n^{-1/k})$
  when $P$ has bounded covariance. Our efficient procedure relies on a novel trace
  norm approximation of an ideal yet intractable 2-Wasserstein projection estimator.
  We apply this algorithm to robust stochastic optimization, and, in the process,
  uncover a new method for overcoming the curse of dimensionality in Wasserstein distributionally
  robust optimization.
