title: On sampling diluted Spin-Glasses using  Glauber Dynamics
section: Original Papers
abstract: " {\\em Spin-glasses}  are natural  Gibbs distributions that have  been
  studied in theoretical computer science for many decades. Recently,   they have
  been gaining renewed attention from the community  as they emerge naturally in {\\em
  neural computation} and {\\em learning},  {\\em network inference}, {\\em optimisation}
  \ and many other areas. Here we consider the {\\em {2-spin model}}  at inverse temperature
  $\\beta$ when the underlying graph is an instance of $G(n,d/n)$, i.e., the random
  graph on $n$ vertices such that  each edge appears independently with probability
  $d/n$,  where the expected degree $d=\\Theta(1)$. We study the problem of efficiently
  \ sampling from the aforementioned distribution using the well-known Markov chain
  called {\\em Glauber dynamics}. For a certain range of $\\beta$, that depends only
  on the expected degree $d$ of the graph, and for typical instances of the {2-spin
  model} on $G(n,d/n)$, we show that the corresponding (single-site) Glauber dynamics
  exhibits mixing time $O\\left(n^{2+\\frac{3}{\\log^2 d}}\\right)$.  The range of
  \  $\\beta$  for which we obtain our rapid mixing result corresponds to the expected
  influence being smaller than $1/d$.  We establish our results by utilising the well-known
  {\\em path-coupling} technique. In the standard setting of Glauber dynamics on $G(n,d/n)$
  one has to deal with the so-called effect of high degree vertices. % in the path-coupling
  analysis. Here, with the spin-glasses, rather than considering  vertex-degrees,
  it is more natural to use a different measure on the vertices of the graph, that
  \ we call {\\em aggregate influence}.  We  build  on the block-construction approach
  proposed by  [Dyer, Flaxman, Frieze and Vigoda: 2006] to circumvent the problem
  with the high degrees in the path-coupling analysis. Specifically, to obtain our
  results, we first  establish rapid mixing for an  appropriately defined block-dynamics.
  We design this dynamics such that vertices of large aggregate influence are placed
  deep inside their blocks. Then, we  obtain  rapid mixing for the (single-site) Glauber
  dynamics  by utilising  a comparison argument. "
