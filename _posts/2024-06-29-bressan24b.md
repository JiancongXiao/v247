title: Efficient Algorithms for Learning Monophonic Halfspaces in Graphs
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study the problem of learning a binary classifier on the vertices of
  a graph. In particular, we consider classifiers given by \emph{monophonic halfspaces},
  partitions of the vertices that are convex in a certain abstract sense. Monophonic
  halfspaces, and related notions such as geodesic halfspaces, have recently attracted
  interest, and several connections have been drawn between their properties (e.g.,
  their VC dimension) and the structure of the underlying graph $G$. We prove several
  novel results for learning monophonic halfspaces in the supervised, online, and
  active settings. Our main result is that a monophonic halfspace can be learned with
  near-optimal passive sample complexity in time polynomial in $n=|V(G)|$. This requires
  us to devise a polynomial-time algorithm for consistent hypothesis checking, based
  on several structural insights on monophonic halfspaces and on a reduction to 2-satisfiability.
  We prove similar results for the online and active settings. We also show that the
  concept class can be enumerated with delay $\mathrm{poly}(n)$, and that empirical
  risk minimization can be performed in time $2^{\omega(G)}\mathrm{poly}(n)$ where
  $\omega(G)$ is the clique number of $G$. These results answer open questions from
  the literature  (Gonz\Â´{a}lez et al., 2020), and show a contrast with geodesic
  halfspaces, for which some of the said problems are NP-hard (Seiffarth et al., 2023).
