title: Nearly Optimal Regret for Decentralized Online Convex Optimization
section: Original Papers
abstract: We investigate decentralized online convex optimization (D-OCO), in which
  a set of local learners are required to minimize a sequence of global loss functions
  using only local computations and communications. Previous studies have established
  $O(n^{5/4}\rho^{-1/2}\sqrt{T})$ and ${O}(n^{3/2}\rho^{-1}\log T)$ regret bounds
  for convex and strongly convex functions respectively, where $n$ is the number of
  local learners, $\rho<1$ is the spectral gap of the communication matrix, and $T$
  is the time horizon. However, there exist large gaps from the existing lower bounds,
  i.e., $\Omega(n\sqrt{T})$ for convex functions and $\Omega(n)$ for strongly convex
  functions. To fill these gaps, in this paper, we first develop novel D-OCO algorithms
  that can respectively reduce the regret bounds for convex and strongly convex functions
  to $\tilde{O}(n\rho^{-1/4}\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{O}(n\rho^{-1/2}\log T)$. The primary
  technique is to design an online accelerated gossip strategy that enjoys a faster
  average consensus among local learners. Furthermore, by carefully exploiting the
  spectral properties of a specific network topology, we enhance the lower bounds
  for convex and strongly convex functions to $\Omega(n\rho^{-1/4}\sqrt{T})$ and $\Omega(n\rho^{-1/2})$,
  respectively. These lower bounds suggest that our algorithms are nearly optimal
  in terms of $T$, $n$, and $\rho$.
