title: Online Stackelberg Optimization via Nonlinear Control
section: Original Papers
abstract: In repeated interaction problems with adaptive agents, our objective often
  requires anticipating and optimizing over the space of possible agent responses.
  We show that many problems of this form can be cast as instances of online (nonlinear)
  control which satisfy \textit{local controllability}, with convex losses over a
  bounded state space which encodes agent behavior, and we introduce a unified algorithmic
  framework for tractable regret minimization in such cases. When the instance dynamics
  are known but otherwise arbitrary, we obtain oracle-efficient $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret
  by reduction to online convex optimization, which can be made computationally efficient
  if dynamics are locally \textit{action-linear}. In the presence of adversarial disturbances
  to the state, we give tight bounds in terms of either the cumulative or per-round
  disturbance magnitude (for \textit{strongly} or \textit{weakly} locally controllable
  dynamics, respectively). Additionally, we give sublinear regret results for the
  cases of unknown locally action-linear dynamics as well as for  the bandit feedback
  setting. Finally, we demonstrate applications of our framework to well-studied problems
  including performative prediction, recommendations for adaptive agents, adaptive
  pricing of real-valued goods, and repeated gameplay against no-regret learners,
  directly yielding  extensions beyond prior results in each case.
