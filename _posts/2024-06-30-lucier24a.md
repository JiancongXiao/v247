title: 'Autobidders with Budget and ROI Constraints: Efficiency, Regret, and Pacing
  Dynamics'
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We study a game between autobidding algorithms that compete in an online
  advertising platform. Each autobidder is tasked with maximizing its advertiser’s
  total value over multiple rounds of a repeated auction, subject to budget and return-on-investment
  constraints. We propose a gradient-based learning algorithm that is guaranteed to
  satisfy all constraints and achieves vanishing individual regret. Our algorithm
  uses only bandit feedback and can be used with the first- or second-price auction,
  as well as with any “intermediate” auction format. Our main result is that when
  these autobidders play against each other, the resulting expected liquid welfare
  over all rounds is at least half of the expected optimal liquid welfare achieved
  by any allocation. Our analysis holds whether or not the bidding dynamics converges
  to an equilibrium, side-stepping the dearth of provable convergence guarantees in
  the literature and the hardness result (Chen et al., 2021) which precludes such
  guarantees for budget-constrained second-price auctions. Our vanishing-regret result
  extends to an adversarial environment, without any assumptions on the other agents.
  We adopt a non-standard benchmark: the sequence of bids such that each bid $b_t$
  maximizes value for the environment in round $t$. Hence, we side-step the impossibility
  results for the standard benchmark of best fixed bid (Balseiro and Gur, 2019). When
  there is only a budget constraint, our algorithm specializes to the autobidding
  algorithm from (Balseiro and Gur, 2019), and our guarantees specialize to the regret
  and liquid welfare guarantees from Gaitonde et al. (2023). While our approach to
  bounding liquid welfare shares a common high-level strategy with Gaitonde et al.
  (2023), handling the ROI constraint, and particularly both constraints jointly,
  introduces a variety of new technical challenges. These challenges necessitate a
  new algorithm, changes to the way liquid welfare bounds are established, and a different
  methodology for establishing regret properties.'
