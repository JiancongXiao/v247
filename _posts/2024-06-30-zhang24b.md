title: Optimal Multi-Distribution Learning
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Multi-distribution learning (MDL), which seeks to learn a shared model
  that minimizes the worst-case risk across $k$ distinct data distributions, has emerged
  as a unified framework in response to the evolving demand for robustness, fairness,
  multi-group collaboration, etc.  Achieving data-efficient MDL necessitates adaptive
  sampling, also called on-demand sampling, throughout the learning process. However,
  there exist substantial gaps between the state-of-the-art upper and lower bounds
  on the optimal sample complexity. Focusing on a hypothesis class of Vapnik-Chervonenkis
  (VC) dimension $d$,  we propose a novel algorithm that yields an $\varepsilon$-optimal
  randomized hypothesis with a sample complexity on the order of $\frac{d+k}{\varepsilon^2}$
  (modulo some logarithmic factor), matching the best-known lower bound. Our algorithmic
  ideas and theory have been further extended to accommodate Rademacher classes. The
  proposed algorithms are oracle-efficient, which access the hypothesis class solely
  through an empirical risk minimization oracle. Additionally, we establish the necessity
  of randomization, unveiling a large sample size barrier when only deterministic
  hypotheses are permitted. These findings successfully resolve three open problems
  presented in COLT 2023 (i.e., Problems 1, 3 and 4 of Awasthi et al. 2023).    '
