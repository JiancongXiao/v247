title: Minimax Linear Regression under the Quantile Risk
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study the problem of designing minimax procedures in linear regression
  under the quantile risk. We start by considering the realizable setting with independent
  Gaussian noise, where for any given noise level and distribution of inputs, we obtain
  the \emph{exact} minimax quantile risk for a rich family of error functions and
  establish the minimaxity of OLS. This improves on the lower bounds obtained by Lecue
  and Mendelson (2016) and Mendelson (2017) for the special case of square error,
  and provides us with a lower bound on the minimax quantile risk over larger sets
  of distributions.  Under the square error and a fourth moment assumption on the
  distribution of inputs, we show that this lower bound is tight over a larger class
  of problems. Specifically, we prove a matching upper bound on the worst-case quantile
  risk of a variant of the procedure proposed by Lecue and Lerasle (2020), thereby
  establishing its minimaxity, up to absolute constants. We illustrate the usefulness
  of our approach by extending this result to all $p$-th power error functions for
  $p \in (2, \infty)$. Along the way, we develop a generic analogue to the classical
  Bayesian method for lower bounding the minimax risk when working with the quantile
  risk, as well as a tight characterization of the quantiles of the smallest eigenvalue
  of the sample covariance matrix.
