title: Correlated Binomial Process
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'Cohen and Kontorovich (COLT 2023) initiated the study of what we call here
  the Binomial Empirical Process: the maximal empirical mean deviation for sequences
  of binary random variables (up to rescaling, the empirical mean of each entry of
  the random sequence is a binomial hence the naming). They almost fully analyzed
  the case where the binomials are independent, which corresponds to all random variable
  entries from the sequence being independent. The remaining gap was closed by Blanchard
  and Voráček (ALT 2024). In this work, we study the much more general and challenging
  case with correlations. In contradistinction to Gaussian processes, whose behavior
  is characterized by the covariance structure, we discover that, at least  somewhat
  surprisingly, for binomial processes covariance does not even characterize convergence.
  Although a full characterization remains out of reach, we take the first steps with
  nontrivial upper and lower bounds in terms of covering numbers.'
