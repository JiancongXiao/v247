title: Is Efficient PAC Learning Possible with an Oracle That Responds "Yes" or "No"?
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'The \emph{empirical risk minimization (ERM)} principle has been highly
  impactful in machine learning, leading both to near-optimal theoretical guarantees
  for ERM-based learning algorithms as well as driving many of the recent empirical
  successes in deep learning. In this paper, we investigate  the question of whether
  the ability to perform ERM, which computes a hypothesis minimizing empirical risk
  on a given dataset, is necessary for efficient learning: in particular, is there
  a weaker oracle than ERM  which can nevertheless enable learnability? We answer
  this question affirmatively, showing that in the realizable setting of PAC learning
  for binary classification, a concept class can be learned using an oracle which
  only returns a \emph{single bit} indicating whether a given dataset is realizable
  by some concept in the class. The sample complexity and oracle complexity of our
  algorithm depend polynomially on the VC dimension of the hypothesis class, thus
  showing that there is only a polynomial price to pay for use of our weaker oracle.
  Our results extend to the agnostic learning setting with a slight strengthening
  of the oracle, as well as to the partial concept, multiclass and real-valued learning
  settings. In the setting of partial concept classes, prior to our work no oracle-efficient
  algorithms were known, even with a standard ERM oracle. Thus, our results address
  a question of Alon et al. (2021) who asked whether there are algorithmic principles
  which enable efficient learnability in this setting.'
