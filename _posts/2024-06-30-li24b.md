title: Optimistic Rates for Learning from Label Proportions
section: Original Papers
abstract: We consider a weakly supervised learning problem called Learning from Label
  Proportions (LLP), where examples are grouped into "bags" and only the average label
  within each bag is revealed to the learner. We study various learning rules for
  LLP that achieve PAC learning guarantees for classification loss. We establish that
  the classical Empirical Proportional Risk Minimization (EPRM) learning rule (Yu
  et al., 2014) achieves fast rates under realizability, but EPRM and similar proportion
  matching learning rules can fail in the agnostic setting. We also show that (1)
  a debiased proportional square loss, as well as (2) a recently proposed EasyLLP
  learning rule (Busa-Fekete et al., 2023) both achieve "optimistic rates" (Panchenko,
  2002); in both the realizable and agnostic settings, their sample complexity is
  optimal (up to log factors) in terms of $\epsilon, \delta$, and VC dimension.
