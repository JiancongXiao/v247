title: List Sample Compression and Uniform Convergence
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'List learning is a variant of supervised classification where the learner
  outputs multiple plausible labels for each instance rather than just one.  We investigate
  classical principles related to generalization within the context of list learning.
  Our primary goal is to determine whether classical principles in the PAC setting
  retain their applicability in the domain of list PAC learning. We focus on uniform
  convergence (which is the basis of Empirical Risk Minimization) and on sample compression
  (which is a powerful manifestation of Occam’s Razor). In classical PAC learning,
  both uniform convergence and sample compression satisfy a form of ‘completeness’:
  whenever a class is learnable, it can also be learned by a learning rule that adheres
  to these principles. We ask whether the same completeness holds true in the list
  learning setting. We show that uniform convergence remains equivalent to learnability
  in the list PAC learning setting. In contrast, our findings reveal surprising results
  regarding sample compression: we prove that when the label space is $Y=\{0,1,2\}$,
  then there are 2-list-learnable classes that cannot be compressed. This refutes
  the list version of the sample compression conjecture by Littlestone and Warmuth
  in 1986. We prove an even stronger impossibility result, showing that there are
  $2$-list-learnable classes that cannot be compressed even when the reconstructed
  function can work with lists of arbitrarily large size. We prove a similar result
  for (1-list) PAC learnable classes when the label space is unbounded.'
