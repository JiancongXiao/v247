title: 'Harmonics of Learning: Universal Fourier Features Emerge in Invariant Networks'
section: Original Papers
abstract: In this work, we formally prove that, under certain conditions, if a neural
  network is invariant to a finite group then its weights recover the Fourier transform
  on that group. This provides a mathematical explanation for the emergence of Fourier
  features â€“ a ubiquitous phenomenon in both biological and artificial learning systems.
  The results hold even for non-commutative groups, in which case the Fourier transform
  encodes all the irreducible unitary group representations. Our findings have consequences
  for the problem of symmetry discovery. Specifically, we demonstrate that the algebraic
  structure of an unknown group can be recovered from the weights of a network that
  is at least approximately invariant within certain bounds. Overall, this work contributes
  to a foundation for an algebraic learning theory of invariant neural network representations.
