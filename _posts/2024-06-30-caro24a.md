title: Information-theoretic generalization bounds for learning from quantum data
section: Original Papers
abstract: Learning tasks play an increasingly prominent role in quantum information
  and computation. They range from fundamental problems such as state discrimination
  and metrology over the framework of quantum probably approximately correct (PAC)
  learning, to the recently proposed shadow variants of state tomography. However,
  the many directions of quantum learning theory have so far evolved separately. We
  propose a mathematical formalism for describing quantum learning by training on
  classical-quantum data and then testing how well the learned hypothesis generalizes
  to new data. In this framework, we prove bounds on the expected generalization error
  of a quantum learner in terms of classical and quantum information-theoretic quantities
  measuring how strongly the learner’s hypothesis depends on the data seen during
  training. To achieve this, we use tools from quantum optimal transport and quantum
  concentration inequalities to establish non-commutative versions of decoupling lemmas
  that underlie classical information-theoretic generalization bounds. Our framework
  encompasses and gives intuitive generalization bounds for a variety of quantum learning
  scenarios such as quantum state discrimination, PAC learning quantum states, quantum
  parameter estimation, and quantumly PAC learning classical functions. Thereby, our
  work lays a foundation for a unifying quantum information-theoretic perspective
  on quantum learning.
