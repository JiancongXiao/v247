title: Agnostic Active Learning of Single Index Models with Linear Sample Complexity
section: Original Papers
abstract: "  We study active learning methods for single index models of the form
  $F({\\bm x}) = f(⟨{\\bm w}, {\\bm x}⟩)$, where $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$
  and ${\\bx,\\bm w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. In addition to their theoretical interest
  as simple examples of non-linear neural networks, single index models have received
  significant recent attention due to applications in scientific machine learning
  like surrogate modeling for partial differential equations (PDEs). Such applications
  require sample-efficient active learning methods that are robust to adversarial
  noise. I.e., that work even in the challenging agnostic learning setting. We provide
  two main results on agnostic active learning of single index models. First, when
  $f$ is known and Lipschitz, we show that $\\tilde{O}(d)$ samples collected via {statistical
  leverage score sampling} are sufficient to learn a near-optimal single index model.
  Leverage score sampling is simple to implement, efficient, and already widely used
  for actively learning linear models. Our result requires no assumptions on the data
  distribution, is optimal up to log factors, and improves quadratically on a recent
  ${O}(d^{2})$ bound of Gajjar et. al 2023. Second, we show that $\\tilde{O}(d)$ samples
  suffice even in the more difficult setting when $f$ is \\emph{unknown}. Our results
  leverage tools from high dimensional probability, including Dudley’s inequality
  and dual Sudakov minoration, as well as a novel, distribution-aware discretization
  of the class of Lipschitz functions."
