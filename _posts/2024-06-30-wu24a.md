title: Oracle-Efficient Hybrid Online Learning with Unknown Distribution
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study the problem of oracle-efficient hybrid online learning when the
  features are generated by an unknown i.i.d. process and the labels are generated
  adversarially. Assuming access to an (offline) ERM oracle, we show that there exists
  a computationally efficient online predictor that achieves a regret upper bounded
  by $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ for a finite-VC class, and upper bounded by $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{p+1}{p+2}})$
  for a class with $\alpha$ fat-shattering dimension $\alpha^{-p}$. This provides
  the first known oracle-efficient sublinear regret bounds for hybrid online learning
  with an unknown feature generation process. In particular, it confirms a conjecture
  of Lazaric and Munos (2012). We then extend our result to the scenario of shifting
  distributions with $K$ changes, yielding a regret of order $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{4}{5}}K^{\frac{1}{5}})$.
  Finally, we establish a regret of $\tilde{O}((K^{\frac{2}{3}}(\log|\mathcal{H}|)^{\frac{1}{3}}+K)\cdot
  T^{\frac{4}{5}})$ for the contextual $K$-armed bandits with a finite policy set
  $\mathcal{H}$, i.i.d. generated contexts from an unknown distribution, and adversarially
  generated costs.
