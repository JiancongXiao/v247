title: Two fundamental limits for uncertainty quantification in predictive inference
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We study the statistical hardness of estimating two basic representations
  of uncertainty in predictive inference: prediction sets and calibration error. First,
  we show that conformal prediction sets cannot approach a desired weighted conformal
  coverage level—with respect to a family of binary witness functions with VC dimension
  $d$—at a minimax rate faster than $O(d^{1/2}n^{-1/2})$. We also show that the algorithm
  in Gibbs et al. (2023) achieves this rate and that extending our class of conformal
  sets beyond thresholds of non-conformity scores to include arbitrary convex sets
  of non-conformity scores only improves the minimax rate by a constant factor. Then,
  under a similar VC dimension constraint on the witness function class, we show it
  is not possible to estimate the weighted weak calibration error at a minimax rate
  faster than $O(d^{1/4}n^{-1/2})$. We show that the algorithm in Kumar et al. (2019)
  achieves this rate in the particular case of estimating the squared weak calibration
  error of a predictor that outputs $d$ distinct values.'
