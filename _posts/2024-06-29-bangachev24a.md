title: 'Detection of $L_∞$ Geometry in Random Geometric Graphs: Suboptimality of Triangles
  and Cluster Expansion'
section: Original Papers
abstract: In this paper we study the random geometric graph  $\mathsf{RGG}(n,\mathbb{T}^d,\mathsf{Unif},\sigma^q_p,p)$
  with $L_q$ distance where each vertex is sampled uniformly from the $d$-dimensional
  torus and where the connection radius is chosen so that the marginal edge probability
  is $p$. In addition to results addressing other questions, we make progress on determining
  when it is possible to distinguish $\mathsf{RGG}(n,\mathbb{T}^d,\mathsf{Unif},\sigma^q_p,p)$
  from the Erdős-Rényi graph $\ergraph$. Our strongest result is in the setting $q
  = \infty$, in which case $\mathsf{RGG}(n,\mathbb{T}^d,\mathsf{Unif},\sigma^q_p,p)$
  is the \textsf{AND} of $d$ 1-dimensional random geometric graphs. We derive a formula
  similar to the \emph{cluster-expansion} from statistical physics, capturing the
  compatibility of subgraphs from each of the $d$ 1-dimensional copies, and use it
  to bound the signed expectations of small subgraphs. We show that counting signed
  4-cycles is optimal among all low-degree tests, succeeding with high probability
  if and only if $d = \tilde{o}(np).$ In contrast, the signed triangle test is suboptimal
  and only succeeds when $d = \tilde{o}((np)^{3/4}).$ Our result stands in  sharp
  contrast to the existing literature on random geometric graphs (mostly focused on
  $L_2$ geometry) where the signed triangle statistic is optimal.
