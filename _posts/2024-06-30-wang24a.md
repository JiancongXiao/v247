title: Efficient Algorithms for Attributed Graph Alignment with Vanishing Edge Correlation
  Extended Abstract
section: Original Papers
abstract: Graph alignment refers to the task of finding the vertex correspondence
  between two correlated graphs of $n$ vertices. Extensive study has been done on
  polynomial-time algorithms for the graph alignment problem under the Erdős–Rényi
  graph pair model, where the two graphs are Erdős–Rényi graphs with edge probability
  $q_\mathrm{u}$, correlated under certain vertex correspondence. To achieve exact
  recovery of the correspondence, all existing algorithms at least require the edge
  correlation coefficient $\rho_\mathrm{u}$ between the two graphs to be \emph{non-vanishing}
  as $n\rightarrow\infty$. Moreover, it is conjectured that no polynomial-time algorithm
  can achieve exact recovery under vanishing edge correlation $\rho_\mathrm{u}<1/\mathrm{polylog}(n)$.
  In this paper, we show that with a vanishing amount of additional \emph{attribute
  information}, exact recovery is polynomial-time feasible under \emph{vanishing}
  edge correlation $\rho_\mathrm{u} \ge n^{-\Theta(1)}$. We identify a \emph{local}
  tree structure, which incorporates one layer of user information and one layer of
  attribute information, and apply the subgraph counting technique to such structures.
  A polynomial-time algorithm is proposed that recovers the vertex correspondence
  for most of the vertices, and then refines the output to achieve exact recovery.
  The consideration of attribute information is motivated by real-world applications
  like LinkedIn and Twitter, where user attributes like birthplace and education background
  can aid alignment.
