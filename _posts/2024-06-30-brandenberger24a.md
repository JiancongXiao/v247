title: Errors are Robustly Tamed in Cumulative Knowledge Processes
section: Original Papers
abstract: 'We study processes of societal knowledge accumulation, where the validity
  of a new unit of knowledge depends both on the correctness of its derivation and
  on the validity of the units it depends on. A fundamental question in this setting
  is: If a constant fraction of the new derivations is wrong, can investing a constant
  fraction, bounded away from one, of effort ensure that a constant fraction of knowledge
  in society is valid? Ben-Eliezer, Mikulincer, Mossel, and Sudan (ITCS 2023) introduced
  a concrete probabilistic model to analyze such questions and showed an affirmative
  answer to this question. Their study, however, focuses on the simple case where
  each new unit depends on just one existing unit, and units attach according to a
  {\em preferential attachment rule}.  In this work, we consider much more general
  families of cumulative knowledge processes, where new units may attach according
  to varied attachment mechanisms and depend on multiple existing units. We also allow
  a (random) fraction of insertions of adversarial nodes.  We give a robust affirmative
  answer to the above question by showing that for \textit{all} of these models, as
  long as many of the units follow simple heuristics for checking a bounded number
  of units they depend on, all errors will be eventually eliminated. Our results indicate
  that preserving the quality of large interdependent collections of units of knowledge
  is feasible, as long as careful but not too costly checks are performed when new
  units are derived/deposited.'
