title: On Convex Optimization with Semi-Sensitive Features
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study the differentially private (DP) empirical risk minimization (ERM)
  problem under the \emph{semi-sensitive DP} setting where only some features are
  sensitive. This generalizes the Label DP setting where only the label is sensitive.
  We give improved upper and lower bounds on the excess risk for DP-ERM. In particular,
  we show that the error only scales polylogarithmically in terms of the sensitive
  domain size, improving upon previous results that scale polynomially in the size
  of the sensitive domain (Ghazi et al., NeurIPS 2021).
