title: Reconstructing the Geometry of Random Geometric Graphs (Extended Abstract)
section: Original Papers
abstract: Random geometric graphs are random graph models defined on metric spaces.
  Such a  model is defined by first sampling points from a metric space and then connecting
  each pair of sampled points with probability that depends on their distance, independently
  among pairs. In this work we show how to efficiently reconstruct the geometry of
  the underlying space from the sampled graph under the {\em manifold} assumption,
  i.e., assuming that the underlying space is a low dimensional manifold and that
  the connection probability is a strictly decreasing function of the Euclidean distance
  between the points in a given embedding of the manifold in $\mathbb{R}^N$.   Our
  work complements a large body of work on manifold learning, where the goal is to
  recover a manifold from sampled points sampled in the manifold along with their
  (approximate) distance
