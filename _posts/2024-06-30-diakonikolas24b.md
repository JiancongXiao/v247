title: Statistical Query Lower Bounds for Learning Truncated Gaussians
section: Original Papers
abstract: We study the problem of estimating the mean of an identity covariance Gaussian
  in the  truncated setting, in the regime when the truncation set comes from a low-complexity  family
  $\mathcal{C}$ of sets. Specifically, for a fixed but unknown truncation set  $S
  \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, we are given access to samples from the distribution  $\mathcal{N}(\bm{\mu},
  \vec{I})$ truncated to the set $S$. The goal is to estimate $\bm{\mu}$  within accuracy
  $\epsilon>0$ in $\ell_2$-norm. Our main result is a Statistical Query (SQ)  lower
  bound suggesting a super-polynomial information-computation gap for this task. In  more
  detail, we show that the complexity of any SQ algorithm for this problem is  $d^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)}$,
  even when the class $\mathcal{C}$ is simple so that $\mathrm{poly}(d/\epsilon)$  samples
  information-theoretically suffice. Concretely, our SQ lower bound applies when  $\mathcal{C}$
  is a union of a bounded number of rectangles whose VC dimension and Gaussian  surface
  are small. As a corollary of our construction, it also  follows that the complexity
  of the previously known algorithm for this task is qualitatively best possible.
